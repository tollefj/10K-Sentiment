  decrease in demand for our communications sites would materially and adversely affect our operating results and we cannot control that demand  factors affecting the demand for our communications sites and to a lesser extent our network development services could materially and adversely affect our operating results those factors include            increased use of network sharing without compensation to us roaming or resale arrangements by wireless service providers            mergers or consolidations among wireless service providers            zoning environmental health or other government regulations or changes in the application and enforcement thereof            governmental licensing of spectrum or restricting or revoking spectrum licenses            a decrease in consumer demand for wireless services due to general economic conditions or other factors including inflation            the ability and willingness of wireless service providers to maintain or increase capital expenditures on network infrastructure            the financial condition of wireless service providers            delays or changes in the deployment of next generation wireless technologies and            technological changes  any downturn in the economy or disruption in the financial and credit markets could impact consumer demand for wireless services if wireless service subscribers significantly reduce their minutes of use or fail to widely adopt and use wireless data applications our wireless service provider tenants could experience a decrease in demand for their services as a result our tenants may scale back their capital expenditure plans which could materially and adversely affect leasing demand for our communications sites and our network development services business which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition  if our tenants share site infrastructure to a significant degree or consolidate or merge our growth revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected  extensive sharing of site infrastructure roaming or resale arrangements among wireless service providers as an alternative to leasing our communications sites without compensation to us may cause new lease activity to slow if carriers utilize shared equipment rather than deploy new equipment or may result in the decommissioning of equipment on certain existing sites because portions of the tenants networks may become redundant in addition significant consolidation among our tenants may materially and adversely affect our growth and revenues certain combined companies have rationalized duplicative parts of their networks or modernized their networks and these and other tenants could determine not to renew leases with us as a result our ongoing contractual revenues and our future results may be negatively impacted if a significant number of these leases are not renewed  increasing competition for tenants in the tower industry may materially and adversely affect our pricing  our industry is highly competitive and our tenants have numerous alternatives in leasing antenna space competitive pricing for tenants on towers from competitors could materially and adversely affect our lease rates    11    table of contents  we may not be able to renew existing tenant leases or enter into new tenant leases or if we are able to renew or enter new leases it may be at rates lower than our current rates resulting in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and growth rate in addition should inflation rates exceed our fixed escalator percentages in markets where the majority of our leases include fixed escalators our income would be adversely affected increasing competition for tenants or significant increases in inflation rates could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition  competition for assets could adversely affect our ability to achieve our return on investment criteria  we may experience increased competition which could make the acquisition of high quality assets significantly more costly some of our competitors are larger and may have greater financial resources than we do while other competitors may apply lower investment criteria than we do in addition we may not anticipate increased competition entering a particular market or competing for the same assets higher prices for assets could make it more difficult to achieve our return on investment criteria which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition  our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future laws or regulations could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do  our business and that of our tenants are subject to federal state local and foreign regulations in certain jurisdictions these regulations could be applied or enforced retroactively which could require that we modify or dismantle an existing tower zoning authorities and community organizations are often opposed to the construction in their communities which can delay prevent or increase the cost of new tower construction modifications additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demands and requirements in addition in certain foreign jurisdictions we are required to pay annual license fees and these fees may be subject to substantial increases by the government foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and currently are not required to pay license fees may enact license fees which may apply retroactively in certain foreign jurisdictions there may be changes to zoning regulations or construction laws based on site location which may result in increased costs to modify certain of our existing towers or decreased revenue due to the removal of certain towers to ensure compliance with such changes existing regulatory policies may materially and adversely affect the associated timing or cost of construction projects associated with our communications sites and additional regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us or that prevent such projects in certain locations furthermore the tax laws regulations and interpretations governing reits may change at any time perhaps with retroactive effect in addition some of these changes could have a more significant impact on us as compared to other reits due to the nature of our business and our use of trss these factors could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition furthermore some foreign jurisdictions have implemented regulations governing investment funds or their managers which may be interpreted to apply to reits and there is uncertainty as to the interpretation and implementation of these regulations  our leverage and debt service obligations may materially and adversely affect us  our leverage could render us unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due with respect to our indebtedness we are also permitted subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness to draw down on our credit facilities and obtain additional longterm debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs  our leverage could have significant negative consequences to our business results of operations or financial condition including            impairing our ability to meet one or more of the financial ratio covenants contained in our debt agreements or to generate cash sufficient to pay interest or principal due under those agreements which could result in an acceleration of some or all of our outstanding debt and the loss of the towers securing such debt if an uncured default occurs    12    table of contents         increasing our borrowing costs if our current investment grade debt ratings decline            placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources including with respect to acquiring assets            limiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing thereby increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions            requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes including capital expenditures reit distributions and preferred stock dividends            requiring us to issue debt or equity securities or to sell some of our core assets possibly on unfavorable terms to meet payment obligations            limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the markets in which we compete and            limiting our ability to repurchase our common stock or make distributions to our stockholders  in addition to meet the reit distribution requirements and maintain our qualification and taxation as a reit we may need to borrow funds even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable and the reit distribution requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives this would increase our total leverage  failure to successfully and efficiently integrate acquired or leased assets including from the proposed verizon transaction the verizon assets into our operations may adversely affect our business operations and financial condition  integrating acquired portfolios of communications sites may require significant resources as well as attention from our management team in addition we may incur certain nonrecurring charges associated with the integration of acquired or leased assets or businesses into our operations further the significant acquisitionrelated integration costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which such charges are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid for example the integration of the verizon assets which includes up to 11489 towers into our operations will be a significant undertaking and we anticipate that we will incur certain nonrecurring charges associated with the integration of the verizon assets into our operations including costs for tasks such as tower visits and audits and ground and tenant lease verifications additional integration challenges include            transitioning all data related to the verizon assets tenants and landlords to a common information technology system            successfully marketing space on the verizon assets            successfully transitioning the ground lease rent payment and the tenant billing and collection processes            retaining existing tenants on the verizon assets and            maintaining our standards controls procedures and policies with respect to the verizon assets  additionally we may fail to successfully integrate the assets we acquire or fail to utilize such assets to their full capacity if we are not able to meet these integration challenges we may not realize the benefits we expect from our acquired portfolios and businesses including the proposed verizon transaction and our business financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected    13    table of contents our expansion initiatives involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our operating results disrupt our operations or expose us to additional risk  as we continue to acquire communications sites in our existing markets and expand into new markets we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including not meeting our return on investment criteria and financial objectives increased costs assumed liabilities and the diversion of managerial attention due to acquisitions achieving the benefits of acquisitions depends in part on timely and efficiently integrating operations communications tower portfolios and personnel integration may be difficult and unpredictable for many reasons including among other things differing systems and processes cultural differences customary business practices and conflicting policies procedures and operations in addition integrating businesses may significantly burden management and internal resources including the potential loss or unavailability of key personnel  furthermore our international expansion initiatives are subject to additional risks such as those described in the risk factor immediately below some of which may require additional resources and personnel  in addition as a result of prior acquisitions we have a substantial amount of intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap we are required to assess our goodwill and other intangible assets annually or more frequently in the event of circumstances indicating potential impairment to determine if they are impaired if the testing performed indicates that an asset may not be recoverable we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the estimated fair value of other intangible assets in the period the determination is made  our expansion initiatives may not be successful or we may be required to record impairment charges for our goodwill or for other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition  our foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  our international business operations and our expansion into new markets in the future could result in adverse financial consequences and operational problems not typically experienced in the united states we anticipate that our revenues from our international operations will continue to grow accordingly our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally including            changes to existing or new tax laws or methodologies impacting our international operations or fees directed specifically at the ownership and operation of communications sites or our international acquisitions any of which may be applied or enforced retroactively            laws or regulations that tax or otherwise restrict repatriation of earnings or other funds or otherwise limit distributions of capital            changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions including inflation or currency devaluation            changes to zoning regulations or construction laws which could be applied retroactively to our existing communications sites            expropriation or governmental regulation restricting foreign ownership or requiring reversion or divestiture            actions restricting or revoking spectrum licenses or suspending or terminating business under prior licenses    14    table of contents         failure to comply with antibribery laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act or similar local antibribery laws or office of foreign assets control requirements            material site security issues            significant license surcharges            increases in the cost of labor as a result of unionization or otherwise power and other goods and services required for our operations            price setting or other similar laws for the sharing of passive infrastructure and            uncertain or inconsistent laws regulations rulings or results from legal or judicial systems which may be enforced retroactively and delays in the judicial process  we also face risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates including those arising from our operations investments and financing transactions related to our international business volatility in foreign currency exchange rates can also affect our ability to plan forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts our revenues earned from our international operations are primarily denominated in their respective local currencies we have not historically engaged in significant currency hedging activities relating to our nonus dollar operations and a weakening of these foreign currencies against the us dollar would negatively impact our reported revenues operating profits and income  in our international operations many of our tenants are subsidiaries of global telecommunications companies these subsidiaries may not have the explicit or implied financial support of their parent entities  in addition as we continue to invest in joint venture opportunities internationally our partners may have business or economic goals that are inconsistent with ours be in positions to take action contrary to our interests policies or objectives have competing interests in our or other markets that could create conflict of interest issues withhold consents contrary to our requests or become unable or unwilling to fulfill their commitments any of which could expose us to additional liabilities or costs including requiring us to assume and fulfill the obligations of that joint venture  a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants and we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants  a substantial portion of our total operating revenues is derived from a small number of tenants if any of these tenants is unwilling or unable to perform its obligations under our agreements with it our revenues results of operations financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected in the ordinary course of our business we do occasionally experience disputes with our tenants generally regarding the interpretation of terms in our leases historically we have resolved these disputes in a manner that did not have a material adverse effect on us or our tenant relationships however it is possible that such disputes could lead to a termination of our leases with tenants or a material modification of the terms of those leases either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition if we are forced to resolve any of these disputes through litigation our relationship with the applicable tenant could be terminated or damaged which could lead to decreased revenue or increased costs resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition  due to the longterm nature of our tenant leases we depend on the continued financial strength of our tenants many wireless service providers operate with substantial leverage sometimes our tenants or their parent companies face financial difficulty or file for bankruptcy  in addition many of our tenants and potential tenants rely on capital raising activities to fund their operations and capital expenditures which may be more difficult or expensive in the event of downturns in the economy or disruptions in the financial and credit markets if our tenants or potential tenants are unable to raise    15    table of contents  adequate capital to fund their business plans they may reduce their spending which could materially and adversely affect demand for our communications sites and our network development services business if as a result of a prolonged economic downturn or otherwise one or more of our significant tenants experienced financial difficulties or filed for bankruptcy it could result in uncollectible accounts receivable and an impairment of our deferred rent asset tower asset network location intangible asset or customerrelated intangible asset the loss of significant tenants or the loss of all or a portion of our anticipated lease revenues from certain tenants could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition  new technologies or changes in a tenants business model could make our tower leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues  the development and implementation of new technologies designed to enhance the efficiency of wireless networks or changes in a tenants business model could reduce the need for towerbased wireless services decrease demand for tower space or reduce previously obtainable lease rates in addition tenants may have less of their budgets allocated to lease space on our towers as the industry is trending towards deploying increased capital to the development and implementation of new technologies examples of these technologies include spectrally efficient technologies which could relieve a portion of our tenants network capacity needs and as a result could reduce the demand for towerbased antenna space additionally certain small cell complementary network technologies could shift a portion of our tenants network investments away from the traditional towerbased networks which may reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites moreover the emergence of alternative technologies could reduce the need for towerbased broadcast services transmission and reception further a tenant may decide to no longer outsource tower infrastructure or otherwise change its business model which would result in a decrease in our revenue the development and implementation of any of these and similar technologies to any significant degree or changes in a tenants business model could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition  if we fail to remain qualified as a reit we will be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates which may substantially reduce funds otherwise available  effective for the taxable year beginning january 1 2012 we began operating as a reit for federal income tax purposes if we fail to remain qualified as a reit we will be taxed at corporate income tax rates unless certain relief provisions apply  qualification as a reit requires the application of certain highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code which provisions may change from time to time to our operations as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control further tax reform proposals if enacted may adversely affect our ability to remain qualified as a reit or the benefits of remaining so qualified there are limited judicial or administrative interpretations of the relevant provisions of the code  if in any taxable year we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit and are not entitled to relief under the code            we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income            we will be subject to federal and state income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates and            we will be disqualified from reit tax treatment for the four taxable years immediately following the year during which we were so disqualified  any corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate some    16    table of contents  investments to pay any additional tax liability accordingly funds available for investment operations and distribution would be reduced  furthermore as a result of our acquisition of mip tower holdings llc mipt we own an interest in a subsidiary reit the subsidiary reit is independently subject to and must comply with the same reit requirements that we must satisfy in order to qualify as a reit together with all other rules applicable to reits if the subsidiary reit fails to qualify as a reit and certain relief provisions do not apply then i the subsidiary reit would become subject to federal income tax ii the subsidiary reit will be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years immediately following the year during which qualification was lost iii our ownership of shares in such subsidiary reit will cease to be a qualifying asset for purposes of the asset tests applicable to reits and any dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary reit may cease to be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the 75 gross income test and iv we may fail certain of the asset tests applicable to reits in which event we will fail to qualify as a reit unless we are able to avail ourselves of specified relief provisions  complying with reit requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities  our use of trss enables us to engage in nonreit qualifying business activities under the code no more than 25 of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss and other nonqualifying assets this limitation may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments including the purchase of nonqualifying assets the expansion of nonreal estate activities and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our trss and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy  specifically this limitation may affect our ability to make additional investments in our managed networks business or network development services segment as currently structured and operated in other nonreit qualifying operations or assets or in international operations conducted through trss that we do not elect to bring into the reit structure further acquisition opportunities in domestic and international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with certain reit requirements prior to closing  further as a reit we must distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90 of the reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain to meet our annual distribution requirements we may be required to distribute amounts that may otherwise be used for our operations including amounts that may otherwise be invested in future acquisitions capital expenditures or repayment of debt as no more than 25 of our gross income may consist of dividend income from our trss and other nonqualifying types of income our ability to receive distributions from our trss may be limited and may impact our ability to fund distributions to our stockholders or to use income of our trss to fund other investments  in addition the majority of our income and cash flows from our trss are generated from our international operations in many cases there are local withholding taxes and currency controls that may impact our ability or willingness to repatriate funds to the united states to help satisfy reit distribution requirements  certain of our business activities may be subject to corporate level income tax and foreign taxes which reduce our cash flows and may create deferred and contingent tax liabilities  we are subject to certain federal state local and foreign taxes on our income and assets including alternative minimum taxes taxes on any undistributed income and state local or foreign income franchise property and transfer taxes any of these taxes decrease our earnings and our available cash    17    table of contents we are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service and state local and foreign tax authorities the results of an audit and examination of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability  our trs assets and operations will continue to be subject as applicable to federal and state corporate income taxes and to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which those assets and operations are located  we may need additional financing to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our reit distribution requirements  to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our reit distribution requirements we may need to raise additional capital through financing activities asset sales or equity issuances we anticipate that we may need to obtain additional sources of capital in the future to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives and satisfy our reit distribution requirements depending on market conditions we may seek to raise capital through credit facilities or debt or equity offerings an increase in our outstanding debt could lead to a downgrade of our credit rating a downgrade of our credit rating below investment grade could negatively impact our ability to access credit markets or preclude us from obtaining funds on investment grade terms and conditions further certain of our current debt instruments limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur additional financing therefore may be unavailable more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness if we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise we may not be able to fund our capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives or satisfy our reit distribution requirements  if we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers it could adversely affect our business and operating results  our real property interests relating to our towers consist primarily of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses and rightsofway a loss of these interests at a particular tower site may interfere with our ability to operate a tower and generate revenues for various reasons we may not always have the ability to access analyze and verify all information regarding titles and other issues prior to completing an acquisition of communications sites which can affect our rights to access and operate a site from time to time we also experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of ground agreements for land under towers which can affect our ability to access and operate tower sites further for various reasons landowners may not want to renew their ground agreements with us they may lose their rights to the land or they may transfer their land interests to third parties including ground lease aggregators which could affect our ability to renew ground agreements on commercially viable terms a significant number of the communications sites in our portfolio are located on land we lease pursuant to operating leases and the ground leases for these sites have a final expiration date of 2024 and beyond further for various reasons title to property interests in some of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may not be as certain as title to our property interests in the united states our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition  if we are unable or choose not to exercise our rights to purchase towers that are subject to lease and sublease agreements at the end of the applicable period our cash flows derived from such towers will be eliminated  our communications real estate portfolio includes towers that we operate pursuant to lease and sublease agreements that include a purchase option at the end of each lease period we may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase leased or subleased towers at the end of the applicable period or we may choose for business or other reasons not to exercise our right to purchase such towers in the event that we do not exercise these purchase rights or are otherwise unable to acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period we will lose the cash flows derived from such    18    table of contents  towers in the event that we decide to exercise these purchase rights the benefits of the acquisitions of a significant number of towers may not exceed the associated acquisition compliance and integration costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition  restrictive covenants in the agreements related to our securitization transactions our credit facilities and our debt securities could materially and adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility and we may be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock if we fail to pay scheduled dividends on our preferred stock which may jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit  the agreements related to our securitization transactions include operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations among other things the borrowers under the agreements are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets a failure to comply with the covenants in the agreements could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the secured assets and could prevent the borrowers from distributing any excess cash from the operation of such assets to us if the borrowers were to default on any of the loans the servicer on such loan could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the secured assets in which case we could lose such assets and the cash flow associated with such assets  the agreements for our credit facilities also contain restrictive covenants and leverage and other financial maintenance tests that could limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt guaranteeing indebtedness or making distributions to stockholders and engaging in various types of transactions including mergers acquisitions and sales of assets additionally our debt agreements restrict our and our subsidiaries ability to incur liens securing our or their indebtedness these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities if these limits prevent us from satisfying our reit distribution requirements we could fail to qualify for taxation as a reit even if these limits do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit they may prevent us from distributing 100 of our reit taxable income making us subject to federal corporate income tax and potentially a nondeductible excise tax on the retained amounts  further reporting and information covenants in our credit agreements and indentures require that we provide financial and operating information within certain time periods if we are unable to timely provide the required information we would be in breach of these covenants for more information regarding the covenants and requirements discussed above please see item 7 of this annual report under the caption managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resourcesfactors affecting sources of liquidity and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  further the terms of our preferred stock provide that unless full cumulative dividends have been paid or set aside for payment on all outstanding preferred stock for all prior dividend periods no dividends may be declared or paid on our common stock a failure to pay dividends on both our preferred and our common stock might jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes for more information on the terms of our preferred stock see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio emissions especially if these perceived risks are substantiated  public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications technology could slow the growth of wireless companies which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding these perceived health risks could undermine the market acceptance of wireless communications services and increase opposition to the development and expansion of tower sites if a scientific study or court decision resulted in a finding that radio frequency emissions pose health    19    table of contents  risks to consumers it could negatively impact our tenants and the market for wireless services which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition we do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters  we could have liability under environmental and occupational safety and health laws  our operations are subject to the requirements of various federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes as the owner lessee or operator of real property and facilities we may be liable for substantial costs of investigation removal or remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials and for damages and costs relating to offsite migration of hazardous materials without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination we may also be liable for certain costs of remediating contamination at thirdparty sites to which we sent waste for disposal even if the original disposal may have complied with all legal requirements at the time many of these laws and regulations contain information reporting and record keeping requirements we may not be at all times in compliance with all environmental requirements we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and could become more stringent in the future in certain jurisdictions these laws and regulations could be applied or enforced retroactively it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition  our towers data centers or computer systems may be affected by natural disasters and other unforeseen events for which our insurance may not provide adequate coverage  our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as ice and wind storms tornadoes floods hurricanes and earthquakes as well as other unforeseen events such as acts of terrorism any damage or destruction to our towers or data centers or certain unforeseen events may impact our ability to provide services to our tenants  as part of our normal business activities we rely on information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational activities and to maintain our business records our computer systems could fail on their own accord and are subject to interruption or damage from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches including through cyber attack and data theft usage errors catastrophic events such as natural disasters and other events beyond our control although we have disaster recovery programs and security measures in place if our computer systems and our backup systems are compromised degraded damaged or breached or otherwise cease to function properly we could suffer interruptions in our operations or unintentionally allow misappropriation of proprietary or confidential information including information about our tenants or landlords which could damage our reputation and require us to incur significant costs to remediate or otherwise resolve these issues  while we maintain insurance coverage for natural disasters we may not have adequate insurance to cover the associated costs of repair or reconstruction for a major future event further we carry business interruption insurance but our insurance may not adequately cover all of our lost revenue including from new tenants that could have been added to our towers but for the event if we are unable to provide services to our tenants it could lead to tenant loss resulting in a corresponding material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition
