cerc corp also owned approximately 554 of the limited partner interests in enable which owns operates and develops natural gas and crude oil infrastructure assets business segmentsin this managements discussion and analysis we discuss our results from continuing operations on a consolidated basis and individually for each of our business segments we also discuss our liquidity capital resources and critical accounting policies we are first and foremost an energy delivery company and it is our intention to remain focused on these segments of the energy business the results of our business operations are significantly impacted by weather customer growth economic conditions cost management competition rate proceedings before regulatory agencies and other actions of the various regulatory agencies to whose jurisdiction we are subject our electric transmission and distribution services are subject to rate regulation and are reported in the electric transmission amp distribution business segment as are impacts of generationrelated stranded costs and other trueup balances recoverable by the regulated electric utility our natural gas distribution services are also subject to rate regulation and are reported in the natural gas distribution business segment the results of our midstream investments segment are dependent upon the results of enable which are driven primarily by the volume of natural gas natural gas liquids ngls and crude oil that enable gathers processes and transports across its systems and other factors as discussed below under  factors influencing our midstream investments segment a summary of our reportable business segments as of december 31 2015 is set forth belowelectric transmission amp distributionour electric transmission and distribution

independent generators power marketers river authorities and reps the ercot market represents approximately 90 of the 43demand for power in texas and is one of the nations largest power markets transmission and distribution services are provided under tariffs approved by the public utility commission of texas texas utility commissionnatural gas distributioncerc owns and operates our regulated natural gas distribution business ngd which engages in intrastate natural gas sales to and natural gas transportation and storage for approximately 34 million residential commercial and industrial customers in arkansas louisiana minnesota mississippi oklahoma and texasenergy servicescercs operations also include nonrate regulated natural gas sales to and transportation and storage services for commercial and industrial customers in 23 states in the central united statesmidstream investmentswe have a significant equity investment in enable an unconsolidated subsidiary that owns operates and develops natural gas and crude oil assets our midstream investments segment includes equity earnings associated with the operations of enableother operationsour other operations business segment includes office buildings and other real estate used in our business operations and other corporate operations which support all of our business operationsexecutive summaryfactors influencing our businesses and industry trends we expect our and enables businesses to continue to be affected by the key factors and trends discussed below our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us to the extent our underlying assumptions about or interpretations of available information prove to be incorrect our actual results may vary materially from our expected results we are an energy delivery company the majority of our revenues are generated from the sale of natural gas and the transmission and delivery of electricity by our subsidiaries we do not own or operate electric generating facilities or make retail sales to enduse electric customers to assess our financial performance our management primarily monitors operating income and cash flows from our business segments within these broader financial measures we monitor margins operation and maintenance expense interest expense capital spending and working capital requirements in addition to these financial measures we also monitor a number of variables that management considers important to the operation of our business segments including the number of customers throughput use per customer commodity prices and heating and cooling degree days we also monitor system reliability safety factors and customer satisfaction to gauge our performanceto the extent adverse economic conditions affect our suppliers and customers results from our energy delivery businesses may suffer for example our business is largely concentrated in houston texas where a higher percentage of employment is tied to the energy sector relative to other regions of the country although houston texas has a diverse economy employment in the energy industry remains important reduced demand and lower energy prices could lead to financial pressure on some of our customers who operate within the energy industry and impact the growth rate of our customer base given the significant decline in energy and commodity prices in 2015 the rate of growth in employment in houston which had been greater than the national average has declined and is now more in line with the national average we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future also adverse economic conditions coupled with concerns for protecting the environment may cause consumers to use less energy or avoid expansions of their facilities resulting in less demand for our servicesperformance of our electric transmission amp distribution and natural gas distribution business segments is significantly influenced by the number of customers and energy usage per customer weather conditions can have a significant impact on energy usage and we compare our results on a weather adjusted basis in 2015 our houston service area experienced some of the mildest temperatures on record during november and december every state in which we distribute natural gas had a warmer than normal winter in 2015 historically ngd has utilized weather hedges to help reduce the impact of mild weather on its financial results however ngd did not enter a weather hedge for the 20152016 winter season as a result of ngds minnesota division implementing a full decoupling pilot in july 2015 we also have various rate mechanisms in place that help to mitigate the impact of abnormal weather on our financial results in 2014 we experienced a colder than normal january and february and milder 44temperatures for the rest of the year including the summer months in the houston area in 2013 we experienced a colder than normal spring and very cold weather in november and december in houston and all of the states in which we have gas customers our longterm national trends indicate customers have reduced their energy consumption and reduced consumption can adversely affect our results however due to more affordable energy prices and continued economic improvement in the areas we serve the trend toward lower usage has slowed in some of the areas we serve in addition in many of our service areas particularly in the houston area and in minnesota we have benefited from a growth in the number of customers that also tends to mitigate the effects of reduced consumption we anticipate that this trend will continue as the regions economies continue to grow the profitability of our businesses is influenced significantly by the regulatory treatment we receive from the various state and local regulators who set our electric and gas distribution rates our energy services business segment contracts with customers for transportation storage and sales of natural gas on an unregulated basis its operations serve customers in the central united states the segment benefits from favorable price differentials either on a geographic basis or on a seasonal basis while this business utilizes financial derivatives to hedge its exposure to price movements it does not engage in speculative or proprietary trading and maintains a low value at risk level or var to avoid significant financial exposures in 2015 and 2014 energy services exhibited strong commercial and industrial customer results while capitalizing on asset optimization opportunities created by basis volatility extreme cold weather in 2014 also increased throughput and margin from our weather sensitive customers the nature of our businesses requires significant amounts of capital investment and we rely on internally generated cash borrowings under our credit facilities proceeds from commercial paper and issuances of debt and equity in the capital markets to satisfy these capital needs we strive to maintain investment grade ratings for our securities in order to access the capital markets on terms we consider reasonable a reduction in our ratings generally would increase our borrowing costs for new issuances of debt as well as borrowing costs under our existing revolving credit facilities and may prevent us from accessing the commercial paper markets disruptions in the financial markets can also affect the availability of new capital on terms we consider attractive in those circumstances companies like us may not be able to obtain certain types of external financing or may be required to accept terms less favorable than they would otherwise accept for that reason we seek to maintain adequate liquidity for our businesses through existing credit facilities and prudent refinancing of existing debt the regulation of natural gas pipelines and related facilities by federal and state regulatory agencies affects our business in accordance with natural gas pipeline safety and integrity regulations we are making and will continue to make significant capital investments in our service territories which are necessary to help operate and maintain a safe reliable and growing natural gas system our compliance expenses may also increase as a result of preventative measures required under these regulations consequently new rates in the areas we serve are necessary to recover these increasing costswe expect to make contributions to our pension plans aggregating approximately 8 million in 2016 but may need to make larger contributions in subsequent years consistent with the regulatory treatment of such costs we can defer the amount of pension expense that differs from the level of pension expense included in our base rates for our electric transmission amp distribution business segment and natural gas distribution business segment in texas factors influencing our midstream investments segment the results of our midstream investments segment are primarily dependent upon the results of enable which are driven primarily by the volume of natural gas ngls and crude oil that enable gathers processes and transports across its systems which depends significantly on the level of production from natural gas wells connected to its systems across a number of us midcontinent markets aggregate production volumes are affected by the overall amount of oil and gas drilling and completion activities as production must be maintained or increased by new drilling or other activity because the production rate of oil and gas wells declines over time oil and gas producers willingness to engage in new drilling is determined by a number of factors the most important of which are the prevailing and projected prices of natural gas ngls and crude oil the cost to drill and operate a well the availability and cost of capital and environmental and government regulations commodity price changes impact the commoditybased portion of enables gross margin its producer customers decisions to drill and complete wells and its transportation and storage customers decisions to contract capacity on enables system prices of natural gas crude oil and ngls have historically experienced periods of significant volatility enables results are also impacted by the price differentials between receipt and delivery points on its systems enable has attempted to mitigate the impact of commodity prices on its business by entering into hedges focusing on contracting feebased business and converting existing commoditybased contracts to feebased contracts the prices of crude oil ngls and natural gas have continued to decline significantly over the course of 2015 and continuing into 2016 natural gas and crude oil prices have dropped to their lowest levels in over 10 years from a high of 1331 per mmbtu in july 2008 to 163 per mmbtu at december 23 2015 and 14531 per barrel in july 2008 to 2619 per barrel at february 11 2016 respectively 45should lower commodity prices persist or should commodity prices decline further enables future volumes and cash flows may be negatively impacted the level of drilling is expected to positively correlate with longterm trends in commodity prices similarly production levels nationally and regionally generally tend to positively correlate with drilling activity over the past several years there has been a fundamental shift in us natural gas and crude oil production towards tight gas formations and shale plays the emergence of these plays and advancements in technology have been crucial factors that have allowed producers to efficiently extract significant volumes of natural gas and crude oil recently declining crude oil natural gas and ngl prices have resulted in decreases in current and anticipated crude oil and natural gas drilling activity should lower prices and producer activity persist for a sustained period or should prices and producer activity decline further enables future volumes and cash flows may be negatively impacted to maintain and increase throughput volumes on its systems enable must continue to contract its capacity to shippers including producers and marketers enables transportation and storage systems compete for customers based on the type of service a customer needs operating flexibility receipt and delivery points and geographic flexibility and available capacity and price to maintain and increase enables transportation and storage volumes it must continue to contract its capacity to shippers including producers marketers local distribution companies power generators and industrial end users natural gas continues to be a critical component of energy supply and demand in the united states over the long term enables management believes that the prospects for continued natural gas demand are favorable and will be driven by population and economic growth as well as the continued displacement of coalfired electricity generation by natural gasfired electricity generation due to the low prices of natural gas and stricter government environmental regulations on the mining and burning of coal according to the us energy information administration eia demand for natural gas in the electric power sector is projected to increase from approximately 82 tcf in 2013 to approximately 94 tcf in 2040 with a portion of the growth attributable to the retirement of 37 gigawatts of coalfired capacity by 2020 the eia also predicts that low natural gas prices will lead to the increase of natural gas consumption in the industrial sector and to the united states becoming a new exporter of natural gas by mid2017 however the eia expects growth in natural gas consumption for power generation exploration and in the industrial sector to be partially offset by decreased usage in the residential sector enables management believes that increasing consumption of natural gas over the long term will continue to drive demand for enables natural gas gathering processing transportation and storage services enable may access the capital markets to fund expansion capital expenditures historically unit prices of midstream master limited partnerships have experienced periods of volatility in addition because enables common units are yieldbased securities rising market interest rates could impact the relative attractiveness of enables common units to investors further fluctuations in energy and commodity prices can create volatility in enables common unit prices which could impact investor appetite for its common units volatility in energy and commodity prices as well as other macro economic factors could impact the relative attractiveness of enables debt securities to investors as a result of capital market volatility enable may be unable to issue equity or debt on satisfactory terms or at all which may limit its ability to expand its operations or make future acquisitions the regulation of gathering and transmission pipelines storage and related facilities by the ferc and other federal and state regulatory agencies including the dot has a significant impact on enables business for example phmsa has established pipeline integrity management programs that require more frequent inspections of pipeline facilities and other preventative measures which may increase compliance costs and increase the time it takes to obtain required permits additionally increased regulation of oil and natural gas producers including regulation associated with hydraulic fracturing could reduce regional supply of oil and natural gas and therefore throughput on enables gathering systemssignificant eventsimpairment of equity investment we

we own shares of tw common twc common and time common equal to approximately 100 of the reference shares used to calculate our obligation to the holders of the zens notes zens note exchanges result in a cash outflow because tax deferrals related to the zens notes and tw common twc common and time common shares would typically cease when zens notes are exchanged or otherwise retired and tw common twc common and time common shares are sold the ultimate tax liability related to the zens notes continues to increase by the amount of the tax benefit realized each year and there could be a significant cash outflow when the taxes are paid as a result of the retirement of the zens 66notes if all zens notes had been exchanged for cash on december 31 2015 deferred taxes of approximately 450

commodity prices and weather on our operating results and cash flows following enactment of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank in july 2010 the commodity futures trading commission cftc has promulgated regulations to implement doddfranks changes to the commodity exchange act including the definition of commoditybased swaps subject to those regulations the cftc regulations are intended to implement new reporting and record keeping requirements related to their swap transactions and a mandatory clearing and exchangeexecution regime for various types categories or classes of swaps subject to certain exemptions including the tradeoption and enduser exemptions although we anticipate that most if not all of our swap transactions should qualify for an exemption to the clearing and exchangeexecution requirements we will still be subject to record keeping and reporting requirements other changes to the commodity exchange act made as a result of doddfrank and the cftcs implementing regulations could increase the cost of entering into new swapsweather hedgewe have weather normalization or other rate mechanisms that mitigate the impact of weather on ngd in arkansas louisiana mississippi minnesota and oklahoma ngd and electric operations in texas do not have such mechanisms although fixed customer charges are historically higher in texas for ngd compared to our other jurisdictions as a result fluctuations from normal weather may have a positive or negative effect on ngds results in texas and on centerpoint houstons results in

distribution of electricity are collected from reps that supply the electricity centerpoint houston distributes to their customers adverse economic conditions structural problems in the market served by ercot or financial difficulties of one or more reps could impair the ability of these reps to pay for centerpoint houstons services or could cause them to delay such payments centerpoint houston depends on these reps to remit payments on a timely basis and any delay or default in payment by reps could adversely affect centerpoint houstons cash flows in the event of a reps default centerpoint houstons tariff provides a number of remedies including the option for centerpoint houston to request that the texas utility commission suspend or revoke the certification of the rep applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another rep or a provider of last resort if a rep cannot make timely payments however centerpoint houston remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to the replacement rep or the provider of last resort if a rep were unable to meet its obligations it could consider among various options restructuring under the bankruptcy laws in which event such rep might seek to avoid honoring its obligations and claims might be made against centerpoint houston involving payments it had received from such rep if a rep were to file for bankruptcy centerpoint houston may not be successful in recovering accrued receivables owed by such rep that are unpaid as of the date the rep filed for bankruptcy however texas utility commission regulations authorize utilities such as cehe to defer bad debts resulting from defaults by reps for recovery in future rate cases subject to a review of reasonableness and necessity

has contractually agreed that it will not issue additional first mortgage bonds subject to certain exceptionscritical accounting policiesa critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management to make difficult subjective or complex accounting estimates an accounting estimate is an approximation made by management of a financial statement element item or account in the financial statements accounting estimates in our historical consolidated financial statements measure the effects of past business transactions or events or the present status of an asset or liability the accounting estimates described below require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made additionally different estimates that we could have used or changes in an accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition results of operations or cash flows the circumstances that make these judgments difficult subjective andor complex have to do with the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments these estimates may change as new events occur as more experience is acquired as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements we believe the following accounting policies involve the application of critical accounting estimates accordingly these accounting estimates have been reviewed and discussed with the audit committee of the board of directorsaccounting for rate regulationaccounting guidance for regulated operations provides that rateregulated entities account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected our electric transmission amp distribution business segment and our natural gas distribution business segment apply this accounting guidance certain expenses and revenues subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred 69on the balance sheet as regulatory assets or liabilities and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded when it is probable that these items will be recovered or reflected in future rates determining probability requires significant judgment on the part of management and includes but is not limited to consideration of testimony presented in regulatory hearings proposed regulatory decisions final regulatory orders and the strength or status of applications for rehearing or state court appeals if events were to occur that would make the recovery of these assets and liabilities no longer probable we would be required to write off or write down these regulatory assets and liabilities as of december 31 2015 we had recorded regulatory assets of 31 billion and regulatory liabilities of 13 billionimpairment of longlived assets including identifiable intangibles goodwill and equity method investmentswe review the carrying value of our longlived assets including identifiable intangibles goodwill and equity method investments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable and at least annually for goodwill as required by accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets unforeseen events and changes in market conditions could have a material effect on the value of longlived assets including intangibles goodwill and equity method investments due to changes in estimates of future cash flows interest rate and regulatory matters and could result in an impairment charge a loss in value of an equity method investment is recognized when the decline is deemed to be other than temporary we recorded no goodwill impairments during 2015 2014 and 2013 we did not record material impairments to longlived assets including intangibles during 2015 2014 and 2013 we recorded impairments totaling 1225 million to our equity method investments during 2015 and no impairment during 2014 and 2013 see notes 8 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the impairments recorded to our equity method investment in 2015we performed our annual goodwill impairment test in the third quarter of 2015 and determined based on the results of the first step using the income approach no impairment charge was required for any reporting unit our reporting units approximate our reportable segmentsfair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows or multiples of earnings or revenue performance measures the fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniquesthe determination of fair value requires significant assumptions by management which are subjective and forwardlooking in nature to assist in making these assumptions we utilized a thirdparty valuation specialist in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the valuation of each of our reporting units we based our assumptions on projected financial information that we believe is reasonable however actual results may differ materially from those projections these projected cash flows factor in planned growth initiatives and for our natural gas distribution reporting unit the regulatory environment the fair value of our natural gas distribution reporting unit significantly exceeded the carrying value the fair value of our energy services reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by approximately 150 million or approximately 50 excess fair value over the carrying value a key assumption in the income approach was the weighted average cost of capital of 56 and 59 applied in the valuation for natural gas distributions and energy services respectively an increase in the discount rate to greater than 72 a decline in longterm growth rate from 3 to 17 or a decrease in the aggregate cash flows of greater than 33 could have individually triggered a steptwo goodwill impairment evaluation for our energy services reporting unit in 2015although there was not a goodwill asset impairment in our 2015 annual test an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected significant adverse changes in the operating environment an increase in the discount rate changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature or if our market capitalization falls below book value for an extended period of time no impairment triggers were identified subsequent to our 2015 annual testwe determined in connection with our preparation of financial statements for the three months ended september 30 2015 and december 31 2015 respectively that an other than temporary decrease in the value of our investment in enable had occurred the impairment analysis compared the estimated fair value of our investment in enable to its carrying value the fair value of the investment was determined using multiple valuation methodologies under both the market and income approacheskey assumptions in the market approach include recent market transactions of comparable companies and ebitda to total enterprise multiples for comparable companies due to volatility of the quoted price of enables units a volume weighted average price was used under the market approach to best approximate fair value at the measurement date key assumptions in the income 70approach include enables forecasted cash distributions projected cash flows of incentive distribution rights forecasted growth rate of enables cash distributions beyond 2020 and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the estimated future cash flows a weighing of the different approaches was utilized to determine the estimated fair value of our investment in enableas a result of the analysis we recorded other than temporary impairments on our investment in enable of 250 million and 975 million during the three months ended september 30 2015 and december 31 2015 respectively we based our assumptions on projected financial information that we believe is reasonable however actual results may differ materially from those projections it is reasonably possible that the estimate of the impairment of our investment in enable will change in the near term due to the following actual enable cash distribution is materially lower than expected significant adverse changes in enables operating environment increase in the discount rate and changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in natureunbilled energy revenuesrevenues related to electricity delivery and natural gas sales and services are generally recognized upon delivery to customers however the determination of deliveries to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month either electronically through advanced metering system ams meter communications or manual readings at the end of each month deliveries to nonams customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated information regarding deliveries to ams customers after the last billing is obtained from actual ams meter usage data unbilled electricity delivery revenue is estimated each month based on actual ams meter data daily supply volumes and applicable rates unbilled natural gas sales are estimated based on estimated purchased gas volumes estimated lost and unaccounted for gas and tariffed rates in effect as additional information becomes available or actual amounts are determinable the recorded estimates are revised consequently operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimatespension and other retirement planswe sponsor pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering all employees who meet eligibility requirements we use several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans these factors include assumptions about the discount rate expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as estimated by management within certain guidelines in addition our actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense recorded please read  other significant matters  pension plans for further discussion new accounting pronouncementssee note 2o to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect usother significant matterspension plans as discussed in note 6b to our consolidated financial statements we maintain a noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees employer contributions for the qualified plan are based on actuarial computations that establish the minimum contribution required under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa and the maximum deductible contribution for income tax purposes under the terms of our pension plan we reserve the right to change modify or terminate the plan our funding policy is to review amounts annually and contribute an amount at least equal to the minimum contribution required under erisa the minimum funding requirements for the qualified pension plan were 0 87 million and 83 million for 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively we made contributions of 35 million 87 million and 83 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 for the respective years we are not required to make any contribution in 2016 additionally we maintain an unfunded nonqualified benefit restoration plan that allows participants to receive the benefits to which they would have been entitled under our noncontributory pension plan except for the federally mandated limits on qualified plan benefits or on the level of compensation on which qualified plan benefits may be calculated employer contributions for the nonqualified benefit restoration plan represent benefit payments made to participants and totaled 31 million 10 million 71and 8 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively we expect to make contributions aggregating approximately 8 million in 2016 changes in pension obligations and assets may not be immediately recognized as pension expense in the income statement but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants as such significant portions of pension expense recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of benefit payments provided to plan participants as the sponsor of a plan we are required to a recognize on our balance sheet as an asset a plans overfunded status or as a liability such plans underfunded status b measure a plans assets and obligations as of the end of our fiscal year and c recognize changes in the funded status of our plans in the year that changes occur through adjustments to other comprehensive income and regulatory assetsthe projected benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was 2193 million and 2403 million as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively the adoption of the new mortality table by the society of actuaries as of december 31 2014 significantly contributed to the increase in the projected benefit obligation for 2014 as of december 31 2015 the projected benefit obligation exceeded the market value of plan assets of our pension plans by 514 million changes in interest rates or the market values of the securities held by the plan during 2016 could materially positively or negatively change our funded status and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions pension cost was 90 million 77 million and 72 million for 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively of which 59 million 71 million and 64 million impacted pretax earnings respectively included in the 2015 and 2014 pension costs were a 10 million settlement charge and 6 million curtailment loss respectively as discussed below a onetime noncash settlement charge is required when lump sum distributions or other settlements of plan benefit obligations during the year exceed the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic cost for the year due to the amount of lump sum payment distributions from the nonqualified pension plan during the year ended december 31 2015 centerpoint energy recognized a noncash settlement charge of 10 million this charge is an acceleration of costs that would otherwise be recognized in future periods during the fourth quarter of 2014 centerpoint energy received notification from enable of its intent to provide employment offers to substantially all seconded employees as a result an additional pension cost of 6 million was recognized for the curtailment loss related to our pension plans substantially all of the seconded employees became employees of enable effective january 1 2015 the calculation of pension expense and related liabilities requires the use of assumptions changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions two of the most critical assumptions are the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate as of december 31 2015 our qualified pension plan had an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 625 which is a 025 decrease from the rate assumed as of december 31 2014 due to lower expected capital market return rates the expected rate of return assumption was developed using the targeted asset allocation of our plans and the expected return for each asset class we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance plan assets to reduce volatility and better match plan assets and liabilities as of december 31 2015 the projected benefit obligation was calculated assuming a discount rate of 440 which is 035 higher than the 405 discount rate assumed in 2014 the discount rate was determined by reviewing yields on highquality bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency and the expected duration of pension obligations specific to the characteristics of our plan pension cost for 2016 including the benefit restoration plan is estimated to be 102 million of which we expect 66 million to impact pretax earnings based on an expected return on plan assets of 625 and a discount rate of 440 as of december 31 2015 if the expected return assumption were lowered by 050 from 625 to 575 2016 pension cost would increase by approximately 8 million  as of december 31 2015 the pension plan projected benefit obligation including the unfunded benefit restoration plan exceeded plan assets by 514 million if the discount rate were lowered by 050 from 440 to 390 the assumption change would increase our projected benefit obligation by approximately 115 million and decrease our 2016 pension expense by approximately 2 million the expected reduction in pension expense due to the decrease in discount rate is a result of the expected 72correlation between the reduced interest rate and appreciation of fixed income assets in pension plans with significantly more fixed income instruments than equity instruments in addition the assumption change would impact our consolidated balance sheet by increasing the regulatory asset recorded as of december 31 2015 by 101 million and would result in a charge to comprehensive income in 2015 of 9 million net of tax  future changes in plan asset returns assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the pension plan will impact our future pension expense and liabilities we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future
