segmentsin this managements discussion and analysis we discuss our results from continuing operations on a consolidated basis and individually for each of our business segments we also discuss our liquidity capital resources and certain critical accounting policies we are first and foremost an energy delivery company and it is our intention to remain focused on these segments of the energy business the results of our business operations are significantly impacted by weather customer growth economic conditions cost management competition rate proceedings before regulatory agencies and other actions of the various regulatory agencies to whose jurisdiction we are subject our electric transmission and distribution services are subject to rate regulation and are reported in the

distribution services are also subject to rate regulation and are reported in the natural gas distribution business segment the results of our midstream investments segment are dependent upon the results of enable which are driven primarily by the volume of natural gas that enable gathers processes and transports across its systems and other factors as discussed below under  factors influencing our midstream investments segment a summary of our reportable business segments as of december 31 2014 is set forth belowelectric transmission amp distributionour electric transmission and

cercother operationsour other operations business segment includes office buildings and other real estate used in our business operations and other corporate operations which support all of our business operationsexecutive summaryfactors influencing our businesses  we are an energy delivery company the majority of our revenues are generated from the sale of natural gas and the transmission and delivery of electricity by our subsidiaries we do not own or operate electric generating facilities or make retail sales to enduse electric customers to assess our financial performance our management primarily monitors operating income and cash flows from our business segments within these broader financial measures we monitor margins operation and maintenance expense interest expense capital spending and working capital requirements in addition to these financial measures we also monitor a number of variables that management considers important to the operation of our business segments including the number of customers throughput use per customer commodity prices and heating and cooling degree days we also monitor system reliability safety factors and customer satisfaction to gauge our performanceto the extent adverse economic conditions affect our suppliers and customers results from our energy delivery businesses may suffer reduced demand and lower energy prices could lead to financial pressure on some of our customers who operate within the energy industry also adverse economic conditions coupled with concerns for protecting the environment may cause consumers to use less energy or avoid expansions of their facilities resulting in less demand for our servicesperformance of our electric transmission amp distribution and natural gas distribution business segments is significantly influenced by the number of customers and energy usage per customer weather conditions can have a significant impact on energy usage and we compare our results on a weather adjusted basis in 2012 we generally experienced normal weather in the summer months however every state in which we distribute natural gas had the warmest winter on record in 2013 we experienced a colder than normal spring and very cold weather in november and december in houston and all of the states in which we have gas customers the cooler weather continued into 2014 and throughout the year resulting in a colder than normal january and february and milder temperatures for the rest of the year including the summer months in the houston area long term national trends indicate customers have reduced their energy consumption and reduced consumption can adversely affect our results however due to more affordable energy prices and continued economic improvement in the areas we serve the trend toward lower usage has slowed in some of the areas we serve in addition in many of our service areas particularly in the houston area and in minnesota we have benefited from a growth in the number of customers that also tends to mitigate the effects of reduced consumption we anticipate that this trend will continue as the regions economies continue to grow the profitability of our businesses is influenced significantly by the regulatory treatment we receive from the various state and local regulators who set our electric and gas distribution rates our energy services business segment contracts with customers for transportation storage and sales of natural gas on an unregulated basis its operations serve customers in the central united states the segment benefits from favorable price differentials either on a geographic basis or on a seasonal basis while this business utilizes financial derivatives to hedge its exposure to price movements it does not engage in speculative or proprietary trading and maintains a low value at risk level or 43var to avoid significant financial exposures in 2014 basis volatility created asset optimization revenues not experienced in many years and the extreme cold weather increased throughput and margin from our weather sensitive customers lower geographic and seasonal price differentials during 2013 and 2012 adversely affected results for this business segmentthe nature of our businesses requires significant amounts of capital investment and we rely on internally generated cash borrowings under our credit facilities proceeds from commercial paper and issuances of debt and equity in the capital markets to satisfy these capital needs we strive to maintain investment grade ratings for our securities in order to access the capital markets on terms we consider reasonable a reduction in our ratings generally would increase our borrowing costs for new issuances of debt as well as borrowing costs under our existing revolving credit facilities and may prevent us from accessing the commercial paper markets disruptions in the financial markets can also affect the availability of new capital on terms we consider attractive in those circumstances companies like us may not be able to obtain certain types of external financing or may be required to accept terms less favorable than they would otherwise accept for that reason we seek to maintain adequate liquidity for our businesses through existing credit facilities and prudent refinancing of existing debt we expect to make contributions to our pension plans aggregating approximately 66 million in 2015 and may need to make larger contributions in subsequent years consistent with the regulatory treatment of such costs we can defer the amount of pension expense that differs from the level of pension expense included in our base rates for our electric transmission amp distribution business segment and ngd in texas factors influencing our midstream investments segment the results of our midstream investments segment are primarily dependent upon the results of enable which are driven primarily by the volume of natural gas that enable gathers processes and transports across its systems which depends significantly on the level of production from natural gas wells connected to its systems across a number of us midcontinent markets aggregate production volumes are affected by the overall amount of oil and gas drilling and completion activities as production must be maintained or increased by new drilling or other activity because the production rate of oil and gas wells declines over time oil and gas producers willingness to engage in new drilling is determined by a number of factors the most important of which are the prevailing and projected prices of natural gas ngls and crude oil the cost to drill and operate a well the availability and cost of capital and environmental and government regulations prices of natural gas crude oil and ngls have historically experienced periods of significant volatility enables results are also impacted by commodity price differentials between receipt and delivery points on its systems across the various markets that it serves enable has attempted to mitigate the impact of commodity prices on its business by entering into hedges focusing on contracting feebased business and converting existing commoditybased contracts to feebased contracts recently the prices of crude oil ngls and natural gas have declined significantly should lower commodity prices persist enables future volumes and cash flows may be negatively impacted the level of drilling is expected to positively correlate with longterm trends in commodity prices similarly production levels nationally and regionally generally tend to positively correlate with drilling activity over the past several years there has been a fundamental shift in us natural gas and crude oil production towards tight gas formations and shale plays the emergence of these plays and advancements in technology have been crucial factors that have allowed producers to efficiently extract significant volumes of natural gas ngls and crude oil recently declining crude oil and natural gas liquids prices have resulted in current and anticipated decreases in crude oil and natural gas drilling activity should lower prices and producer activity persist for a sustained period enables future volumes and cash flows may be negatively impacted to maintain and increase throughput volumes on its systems enable must continue to contract its capacity to shippers including producers and marketers enables transportation and storage systems compete for customers based on the type of service a customer needs operating flexibility receipt and delivery points and geographic flexibility and available capacity and price to maintain and increase enables transportation and storage volumes it must continue to contract its capacity to shippers including producers marketers ldcs power generators and industrial endusers natural gas continues to be a critical component of energy supply and demand in the united states over the long term enables management believes that the prospects for continued natural gas demand are favorable and will be driven by population and economic growth as well as the continued displacement of coalfired electricity generation by natural gasfired electricity generation due to the low prices of natural gas and stricter government environmental regulations on the mining and burning of coal according to the us energy information administration eia demand for natural gas in the electric power sector is projected to increase from approximately 93 tcf in 2012 to approximately 112 tcf in 2040 with a portion of the growth attributable to the retirement of 50 gigawatts of coalfired capacity by 2020 the eia also projects that natural gas consumption in the industrial sector will be higher due to the rejuvenation of the industrial sector as it benefits from low natural gas prices however the eia expects growth in natural gas consumption for power generation and in the industrial sector to be partially offset by decreased 44usage in the residential sector enables management believes that increasing consumption of natural gas over the long term will continue to drive demand for enables natural gas gathering processing transportation and storage services enable depends on access to the capital markets to fund expansion capital expenditures historically unit prices of publicly traded midstream master limited partnerships have experienced periods of volatility in addition because enables common units are yieldbased securities rising market interest rates could impact the relative attractiveness of enables common units to investors capital market volatility could limit enables ability to timely issue units or debt on satisfactory terms or at all which may limit its ability to expand its operations or make future acquisitions our midstream investments segment currently includes a 01 interest in sesh owned by cerc that may be contributed by cerc to enable in the future upon exercise of certain put or call rights under which cerc would contribute to enable cercs retained interest in sesh significant eventsenable initial public offering on april 16 2014 enable

structuring fees and other offering costsin connection with its ipo on march 25 2014 enable effected a 1 for 1279082616 reverse unit split immediately following the unit split centerpoint energy resources corp cerc corp owned 227508825 common units representing a 583 limited partner interest in enable also in connection with enables ipo 139704916 of cerc corps common units were converted into subordinated units the principal difference between enable common units and subordinated units is that in any quarter during the subordination period holders of the subordinated units are not entitled to receive any distribution of available cash until the common units have received the minimum quarterly distribution plus any arrearages in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution from prior quarters if enable does not pay distributions on its subordinated units the subordinated units will not accrue arrearages for those unpaid distributions at the end of the subordination period centerpoint energys subordinated units in enable will be converted to common units in enable on a oneforone basissubsequent to the ipo enable continues to be controlled jointly by centerpoint energy and oge each own 50 of the management rights in the general partner of enable centerpoint energy and oge also own a 40 and 60 economic interest respectively in the incentive distribution rights held by the general partner of enableas a result of enables ipo centerpoint energys limited partner interest in enable was reduced from approximately 583 to approximately 547 centerpoint energy accounted for the dilution of its investment in enable as a result of enables ipo as a failed partial sale of insubstance real estate centerpoint energy did not receive any cash from enables ipo and as such centerpoint energy did not recognize a gain or loss centerpoint energys basis difference in enable was reduced for the impact of the enable ipoin accordance with the enable formation agreements

in enable from approximately 547 to approximately 554 no cash payment was required to be made pursuant to the enable formation agreements in connection with centerpoint energys exercise of the 2495 put centerpoint energy accounted for the contribution of its 2495 interest in sesh to enable in exchange for common units of enable as a nonmonetary transaction of insubstance real estate equity method investments as such centerpoint energy recorded the 6322457 common units at the historical cost of the contributed 2495 interest in sesh of 196 million and recorded no gain or loss in connection with its exercise of the 2495 put as a result centerpoint energys basis difference in enable was reduced for the impact of its exercise of the 2495 putcenterpoint energy incurred natural

doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank in july 2010 the commodity futures trading commission cftc has promulgated regulations to implement doddfranks changes to the commodity exchange act including the definition of commoditybased swaps subject to those regulations the cftc regulations are intended to implement new reporting and record keeping requirements related to their swap transactions and a mandatory clearing and exchangeexecution regime for various types categories or classes of swaps subject to certain exemptions including the tradeoption and enduser exemptions although we anticipate that most if not all of our swap transactions should qualify for an exemption to the clearing and 64exchangeexecution requirements we will still be subject to record keeping and reporting requirements other changes to the commodity exchange act made as a result of doddfrank and the cftcs implementing regulations could increase the cost of entering into new swapscollection of receivables from repscenterpoint houstons receivables from the distribution of electricity are collected from reps that supply the electricity centerpoint houston distributes to their customers adverse economic conditions structural problems in the market served by ercot or financial difficulties of one or more reps could impair the ability of these reps to pay for centerpoint houstons services or could cause them to delay such payments centerpoint houston depends on these reps to remit payments on a timely basis and any delay or default in payment by reps could adversely affect centerpoint houstons cash flows in the event of a reps default centerpoint houstons tariff provides a number of remedies including the option for centerpoint houston to request that the texas utility commission suspend or revoke the certification of the rep applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another rep or a provider of last resort if a rep cannot make timely payments however centerpoint houston remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to the replacement rep or the provider of last resort if a rep were unable to meet its obligations it could consider among various options restructuring under the bankruptcy laws in which event such rep might seek to avoid honoring its obligations and claims might be made against centerpoint houston involving payments it had received from such rep if a rep were to file for bankruptcy centerpoint houston may not be successful in recovering accrued receivables owed by such rep that are unpaid as of the date the rep filed for bankruptcy however texas utility commission regulations authorize utilities such as cehe to defer bad debts resulting from defaults by reps

to 70 if centerpoint houston experiences damage from a natural disaster in its service territory that meets certain criteria additionally centerpoint houston has contractually agreed that it will not issue additional first mortgage bonds subject to certain exceptionscritical accounting policiesa critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management to make difficult subjective or complex accounting estimates an accounting estimate is an approximation made by management of a financial statement element item or account in the financial statements accounting estimates in our historical consolidated financial statements measure the effects of past business transactions or events or the present status of an asset or liability the accounting estimates described below require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made additionally different estimates that we could have used or changes in an accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition results of operations or cash flows the circumstances that make these judgments difficult subjective andor complex have to do with the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments these estimates may change as new events occur as more experience is acquired as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements we believe the following accounting policies involve the application of critical accounting estimates accordingly these accounting estimates have been reviewed and discussed with the audit committee of the board of directorsaccounting for rate regulationaccounting guidance for regulated operations provides that rateregulated entities account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected our electric transmission amp distribution business segment and our natural gas distribution business segment apply this accounting guidance certain expenses and revenues subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet as regulatory assets or liabilities and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded when it is probable that these items will be recovered or reflected in future rates determining probability requires significant judgment on the part of management and includes but is not limited to consideration of testimony presented in regulatory hearings proposed regulatory decisions final regulatory orders and the strength or status of applications for rehearing or state court appeals if events were to occur that would make the recovery of these assets and liabilities no longer probable we would be required to write off or write down these regulatory assets and liabilities at december 31 2014 we had recorded regulatory assets of 35 billion and regulatory liabilities of 12 billionimpairment of longlived assets including identifiable intangibles goodwill and equity method investmentswe review the carrying value of our longlived assets including identifiable intangibles goodwill and equity method investments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable and at least annually for goodwill as required by accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets a loss in value of an equity method investment is recognized when the decline is deemed to be other than temporary unforeseen events and changes in market conditions could have a material effect on the value of longlived assets including intangibles goodwill and equity method investments due to changes in estimates of future cash flows interest rate and regulatory matters and could result in an impairment charge we recorded goodwill impairment of 0 during 2014 and 2013 and 252 million during 2012 we did not record material impairments to longlived assets including intangibles or equity method investments during 2014 2013 and 201266we performed our annual goodwill impairment test in the third quarter of 2014 and determined based on the results of the first step using the income approach no impairment charge was required for any reporting unit our reporting units approximate our reportable segmentsfair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows or multiples of earnings or revenue performance measures the fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniquesthe determination of fair value requires significant assumptions by management which are subjective and forwardlooking in nature to assist in making these assumptions we utilized a thirdparty valuation specialist in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the valuation of each of our reporting units we based our assumptions on projected financial information that we believe is reasonable however actual results may differ materially from those projections these projected cash flows factor in planned growth initiatives and for our natural gas distribution reporting unit the regulatory environment the fair value of our natural gas distribution reporting unit significantly exceeded the carrying value the fair value of our energy services reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by approximately 50 million or approximately 14 excess fair value over the carrying value a key assumption in the income approach was the weighted average cost of capital of 55 and 59 applied in the valuation for natural gas distributions and energy services respectively an increase in the discount rate to greater than 65 a decline in longterm growth rate from 3 to 23 or a decrease in the aggregate cash flows of greater than 15 could have individually triggered a steptwo goodwill impairment evaluation for our energy services reporting unit in 2014although there was not a goodwill asset impairment in our 2014 annual test an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected significant adverse changes in the operating environment an increase in the discount rate changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature or if our market capitalization falls below book value for an extended period of time no impairment triggers were identified subsequent to our 2014 annual testunbilled energy revenuesrevenues related to electricity delivery and natural gas sales and services are generally recognized upon delivery to customers however the determination of deliveries to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month either electronically through ams meter communications or manual readings at the end of each month deliveries to nonams customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated information regarding deliveries to ams customers after the last billing is obtained from actual ams meter usage data unbilled electricity delivery revenue is estimated each month based on actual ams meter data daily supply volumes and applicable rates unbilled natural gas sales are estimated based on estimated purchased gas volumes estimated lost and unaccounted for gas and tariffed rates in effect as additional information becomes available or actual amounts are determinable the recorded estimates are revised consequently operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimatespension and other retirement planswe sponsor pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering all employees who meet eligibility requirements we use several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans these factors include assumptions about the discount rate expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as estimated by management within certain guidelines in addition our actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense recorded please read  other significant matters  pension plans for further discussion new accounting pronouncementssee note 2o to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us67other significant matterspension plans as discussed in note 6b to our consolidated financial statements we maintain a noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees employer contributions for the qualified plan are based on actuarial computations that establish the minimum contribution required under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa and the maximum deductible contribution for income tax purposes under the terms of our pension plan we reserve the right to change modify or terminate the plan our funding policy is to review amounts annually and contribute an amount at least equal to the minimum contribution required under erisa the minimum funding requirements for the qualified pension plan were 87 million 83 million and 73 million for 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively we made contributions of 87 million 83 million and 73 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 for the respective years we expect to make contributions aggregating approximately 35 million in 2015 additionally we maintain an unfunded nonqualified benefit restoration plan that allows participants to receive the benefits to which they would have been entitled under our noncontributory pension plan except for the federally mandated limits on qualified plan benefits or on the level of compensation on which qualified plan benefits may be calculated employer contributions for the nonqualified benefit restoration plan represent benefit payments made to participants and totaled 10 million 8 million and 9 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively we expect to make contributions aggregating approximately 31 million in 2015 changes in pension obligations and assets may not be immediately recognized as pension expense in the income statement but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants as such significant portions of pension expense recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of benefit payments provided to plan participants as the sponsor of a plan we are required to a recognize on our balance sheet as an asset a plans overfunded status or as a liability such plans underfunded status b measure a plans assets and obligations as of the end of our fiscal year and c recognize changes in the funded status of our plans in the year that changes occur through adjustments to other comprehensive income and regulatory assetsthe projected benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was 2403 million and 2153 million as of december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively the adoption of the new mortality table by the society of actuaries as of december 31 2014 significantly contributed to the increase in the projected benefit obligation for the year as of december 31 2014 the projected benefit obligation exceeded the market value of plan assets of our pension plans by 478 million changes in interest rates or the market values of the securities held by the plan during 2015 could materially positively or negatively change our funded status and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions pension cost was 77 million 72 million and 82 million for 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively of which 71 million 64 million and 67 million impacted pretax earnings included in the 2014 pension cost was 6 million related to the curtailment loss discussed below during the fourth quarter of 2014 centerpoint energy received notification from enable of its intent to provide employment offers to substantially all seconded employees as a result an additional pension cost of 6 million was recognized for the curtailment loss related to our pension plans substantially all of the seconded employees became employees of enable effective january 1 2015 the calculation of pension expense and related liabilities requires the use of assumptions changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions two of the most critical assumptions are the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate as of december 31 2014 our qualified pension plan had an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 650 which is a 050 decrease from the rate assumed as of december 31 2013 due to the increase in the allocation to fixed income investments in our targeted asset allocation the expected rate of return assumption was developed using the targeted asset allocation of our plans and the expected return for each asset class we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance plan assets to reduce volatility and better match plan assets and liabilities as of december 31 2014 the projected benefit obligation was calculated assuming a discount rate of 405 which is 075 lower than the 480 discount rate assumed in 2013 the discount rate was determined by reviewing yields on highquality bonds 68that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency and the expected duration of pension obligations specific to the characteristics of our plan pension cost for 2015 including the benefit restoration plan is estimated to be 80 million of which we expect 55 million to impact pretax earnings based on an expected return on plan assets of 650 and a discount rate of 405 as of december 31 2014 if the expected return assumption were lowered by 050 from 650 to 600 2015 pension cost would increase by approximately 9 million  as of december 31 2014 the pension plan projected benefit obligation including the unfunded benefit restoration plan exceeded plan assets by 478 million if the discount rate were lowered by 050 from 405 to 355 the assumption change would increase our projected benefit obligation by approximately 130 million and decrease our pension expense by approximately 3 million the expected reduction in pension expense due to the decrease in discount rate is a result of the expected correlation between the reduced interest rate and appreciation of fixed income assets in pension plans with significantly more fixed income instruments than equity instruments in addition the assumption change would impact our consolidated balance sheet by increasing the regulatory asset recorded as of december 31 2014 by 113 million and would result in a charge to comprehensive income in 2014 of 11 million net of tax  future changes in plan asset returns assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the pension plan will impact our future pension expense and liabilities we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be
