generate substantial cash from operating activities and remain in a strong financial position managing our capital structure to meet short and longterm objectives including reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions sources and uses of cash funds generated by operating activities and our credit facilities continue to be our most significant sources of liquidity we expect that funds generated from results of operations will be sufficient to finance our anticipated working capital and other cash requirements such as capital expenditures interest payments debt payments potential pension funding contributions and dividend payments for the foreseeable future in the event that credit market conditions were to deteriorate we would rely more heavily on borrowings from

by the outstanding principal amount of our commercial paper cp notes our 9000 million cp program has been established to allow for borrowing through the private placement of cp with maturities ranging from overnight to 397 days we may use the proceeds of cp for general corporate purposes the cp program is supported by our revolver and pursuant to our existing board of directors authorization the total amount of cp which may be issued is reduced by the amount of any outstanding borrowings under our revolver at december 31 2015 the company had 472 million of cp and 05 million of letters of

issuers the interest rates reset periodically depending on the terms of the respective financing arrangements at december 31 2015 interest rates on our variablerate debt ranged from 065 to 075 the obligations of the lenders to fund the term loan facility and the 364day revolver are subject to certain conditions including the approval by veda shareholders of the acquisition and the nonoccurence

activity of cp notes in 2015 and reflects the increase in cash flow from operations as well as no material acquisitions entered into during the year the increase in net shortterm borrowings repayments

credit facilities entered into in november 2015debt covenants  the outstanding indentures and comparable instruments contain customary covenants including for example limits on secured debt and saleleaseback transactions in addition the senior credit facilities requires us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of not more than 35 to 10 and limits the amount of subsidiary debt the companys leverage ratio was 126 at december 31 2015 none of these covenants are considered restrictive to our operations and as of december 31 2015 the company was in compliance with all of our debt covenants41 the company does not have any credit rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of the outstanding debt however the 63 senior notes due 2017 33 senior notes due 2022 and 70 senior notes due 2037 together the senior notes contain change in control provisions if the company experiences a change of control or publicly announce the companys intention to effect a change of control and the rating on the senior notes is lowered by standard amp poors or sampp and moodys investors service or moodys below an investment grade rating within 60 days of such change of control or notice thereof then the company will be required to offer to repurchase the senior notes at a price equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes plus accrued and unpaid interest credit ratings  credit ratings reflect an independent agencys judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity the ratings reflect many considerations such as the nature of the borrowers industry and its competitive position the size of the company its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a companys cash flows to changes in the economy the two largest rating agencies sampp and moodys use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings the highest quality rating for longterm credit obligations is aaa and aaa for sampp and moodys respectively a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency longterm ratings of bbb and baa3 or better by sampp and moodys respectively reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade at december 31 2015 the longterm ratings for our obligations were bbb and baa1 which are consistent with the ratings and outlooks which existed at december 31 2014 a downgrade in our credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under our cp program and credit facilities and could limit or in the case of a significant downgrade preclude our ability to issue cp if our credit ratings were to decline to lower levels we could experience increases in the interest cost for any new debt in addition the markets demand for and thus our ability to readily issue new debt could become further affected by the

the usrip met or exceeded erisas minimum funding requirements during the twelve months ended december 31 2015 and 2014 we did not make any contributions to the usrip we contributed 02 million and 12 million to the crip during the twelve months ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively in the future we will make minimum funding contributions as required and may make discretionary contributions depending on certain circumstances including market conditions and liquidity needs we believe additional funding contributions if any would not prevent us from continuing to meet our liquidity needs which are primarily funded from cash flows generated by operating activities available cash and cash equivalents and our credit facilities for our nonus taxqualified retirement plans we fund an amount sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements but no more than allowed as a tax deduction pursuant to applicable tax regulations for the nonqualified supplementary retirement plans we fund the benefits as they are paid to retired participants but accrue the associated expense and liabilities in accordance with gaap for additional information about our benefit plans see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this reportseasonality we experience seasonality in certain of our revenue streams revenue generated from the employer services business unit within the workforce solutions operating segment is generally higher in the first quarter due primarily to the provision of form w2 preparation services which occur in the first quarter each year revenue from our online information solutions and mortgage solutions business units tends to increase in periods of the year in which our customers have higher volumes of credit granting decisions most commonly the second and third calendar quarters revenues in our financial marketing services business line within usis are typically highest in the fourth quarter each year due to the timing of certain significant annual renewals of projectbased agreements on a consolidated basis combining all of these businesses and assuming normal economic conditions first quarter revenue is normally the lowest quarterly revenue of the year and the fourth quarter is the highesteffects of inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates equifaxs operating results are not materially affected by inflation although inflation may result in increases in the companys expenses which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets and upon the value of financial instruments it may adversely affect the companys financial position and profitability 44a portion of the companys business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar can therefore affect the value of nonus dollar net assets revenues and expenses potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency recent accounting pronouncements for information about new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report application of critical accounting policies and estimates the companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap this requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made in addition while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period either of which may have a material impact on the presentation of our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income we also have other significant accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are relevant to understanding our results for additional information about these policies see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information available at the time actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditionsrevenue recognition revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists collectibility of arrangement consideration is reasonably assured the arrangement fees are fixed or determinable and delivery of the product or service has been completed a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the provision of information services to our customers on a transaction basis in which case revenue is recognized assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met when the services are provided a smaller portion of our revenues relate to subscriptionbased contracts under which a customer pays a preset fee for a predetermined or unlimited number of transactions or services provided during the subscription period generally one year revenue related to subscriptionbased contracts having a preset number of transactions is recognized as the services are provided using an effective transaction rate as the actual transactions are completed any remaining revenue related to unfulfilled units is not recognized until the end of the related contracts subscription period revenue related to subscriptionbased contracts having an unlimited volume is recognized ratably during the contract term revenue is recorded net of sales taxes if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that collectibility is not reasonably assured revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment if there is uncertainty as to the customers acceptance of our deliverables revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes fixed or determinable assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been metthe determination of certain of our tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears in these instances we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported in the past differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates and actual reported volumes in the past we monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future if we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained also within our workforce solutions operating segment the fees for certain of our tax credits and incentives revenue are based on a percentage of the credit delivered to our 45clients revenue for these arrangements is recognized based on the achievement of milestones upon calculation of the credit or when the credit is utilized by our client depending on the provisions of the client contract we have certain offerings that are sold as multiple element arrangements the multiple elements may include consumer or commercial information file updates for certain solutions services provided by our decisioning technologies personnel training services statistical models and other services to account for each of these elements separately the delivered elements must have standalone value to our customer if we are unable to unbundle the arrangement into separate units of accounting we apply one of the accounting policies described above this may lead to the arrangement consideration being recognized as the final contract element is delivered to our customer or ratably over the contract many of our multiple element arrangements involve the delivery of services generated by a combination of services provided by one or more of our operating segments no individual information service impacts the value or usage of other information services included in an arrangement and each service can be sold alone or in most cases purchased from another vendor without affecting the quality of use or value to the customer of the other information services included in the arrangement some of our products require the development of interfaces or platforms by our decisioning technologies personnel that allow our customers to interact with our proprietary information databases these development services do not meet the requirement for having standalone value thus any related development fees are deferred when billed and are recognized over the expected period that the customer will benefit from the related decisioning technologies service revenue from the provision of statistical models is recognized as the service is provided and accepted assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met the direct costs of set up of a customer are capitalized and amortized as a cost of service during the term of the related customer contract we have some multiple element arrangements that include software we recognize the elements for which we have established vendor specific objective evidence at fair value upon delivery in accordance with the applicable guidance we record revenue on a net basis for those sales in which we have in substance acted as an agent or broker in the transaction the debt collections and recovery management revenue is calculated as a percentage of debt collected on behalf of the customer and as such is primarily recognized when the cash is collected assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are metdeferred revenue consists of amounts billed and collected in excess of revenue recognized on sales relating generally to the deferral of subscription fees and arrangement consideration from elements not meeting the criteria for having standalone value discussed above deferred revenues are subsequently recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policies judgments and uncertainties  each element of a multiple element arrangement must be considered separately to ensure that appropriate accounting is performed for these deliverables these considerations include assessing the price at which the element is sold compared to its relative fair value concluding when the element will be delivered evaluating collectibility and determining whether any contingencies exist in the related customer contract that impact the prices paid to us for the services in addition as stated above the determination of certain of our marketing information services and tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears in these instances we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported in the past differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported effects if actual results differ from assumptions  we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates of marketing information services and tax management services revenues reported to us by our customers and actual reported volumes in the past we monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future if we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions or if our customer arrangements become more complex or include more bundled offerings in the future we may be required to recognize revenue differently in the future to account for these changes we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to recognize revenue 46goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets we review goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of september 30 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance or trends competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit we have seven reporting units comprised of us information solutions which includes part of online information solutions mortgage solutions and financial marketing services europe latin america canada personal solutions verification services and employer services based on the companys enterprisewide strategy weve consolidated the identity management reporting unit with the us information solutions reporting unit in 2015 we performed goodwill impairment tests prior to

assessmentswe performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing was necessary for all of our reporting units in this qualitative assessment we considered the following items for each of the reporting units macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions overall financial performance and other entity specific events in addition for each of these reporting units the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting units based on these assessments we determined the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is not more likely than not as a result of our conclusions no further testing was required for all of our reporting unitsloss contingencies we are subject to various proceedings lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of our business we determine whether to disclose andor accrue for loss contingencies based on our assessment of whether the potential loss is estimable probable reasonably possible or remote judgments and uncertainties  we periodically review claims and legal proceedings and assess whether we have potential financial exposure based on consultation with internal and outside legal counsel and other advisors if the likelihood of an adverse outcome from any claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability on our consolidated balance sheets for the estimated amount if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is reasonably possible but not probable we provide disclosures related to the potential loss contingency our assumptions related to loss contingencies are inherently subjective effect if actual results differ from assumptions  we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine loss contingencies however if facts and circumstances change in the future that change our belief regarding assumptions used to determine our estimates we may be exposed to a loss that could be material 47income taxes we record deferred income taxes using enacted tax laws and rates for the years in which the taxes are expected to be paid we assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount we estimate will be recoverable our income tax provisions are based on assumptions and calculations which will be subject to examination by various tax authorities we record tax benefits for positions in which we believe are more likely than not of being sustained under such examinations we assess the potential outcome of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax accruals judgments and uncertainties  we consider accounting for income taxes critical because management is required to make significant judgments in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets these judgments and estimates are affected by our expectations of future taxable income mix of earnings among different taxing jurisdictions and timing of the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities we also use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sustain positions that we have taken on tax returns and if so the amount of benefit to initially recognize within our financial statements we review our uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances such as changes in tax law interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law these adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits may affect our income tax expense settlement of uncertain tax positions may require use of our cash at december 31 2015 246 million was recorded for uncertain tax benefits including interest and penalties of which it is reasonably possible that up to 94 million of our unrecognized tax benefit may change within the next twelve months effect if actual results differ from assumptions  although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in income tax expense that could be material pension and other postretirement plans we consider accounting for our us and canadian pension and other postretirement plans critical because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions which include discount rates expected return on plan assets interest cost and mortality and retirement rates actuarial valuations are used in determining our benefit obligation and net periodic benefit costduring 2015 we adopted the new generational projection scale with mp2015 in determining the liability for the us pensions plan this updated scale along with the change in the discount rate contributed to the decrease in the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2015during 2014 the we adopted the new rp2014 mortality tables and generational projection scale with mp2014 in determining the liability for the us pensions plan this new table along with the change in the discount rate contributed to the increase in the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2014judgments and uncertainties  we believe that the most significant assumptions related to our net periodic benefit cost are 1 the discount rate and 2 the expected return on plan assets in each case as it relates to our us pension plan our canadian plan is not significant and the impact of changes in assumptions for that plan is not materialwe determine our discount rates primarily based on highquality fixedincome investments and yieldtomaturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments available as of the measurement date discount rates are updated annually on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions we use a thirdparty yield curve to develop our discount rates the yield curve provides discount rates related to a dedicated highquality bond portfolio whose cash flows extend beyond the current period from which we choose a rate matched to the expected benefit payments required for each plan the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on both our historical returns and forecasted future investment returns by asset class as provided by our external investment advisor in 2015 the us pension plan investment losses of 11 were below the expected return of 75 for the second time in seven years the expected return for the usrip for 2016 is at 725 which is a reduction from the rate used for 2015 the crip earned 29 in 2015 which was below its expected return of 675 for the second time in seven years the expected return for the crip for 2016 is at 60 which is a reduction from 48the rate used for 2015 the crip has a lower expected return due to a higher asset allocation to fixed income securities our weightedaverage expected rate of return for both plans for 2016 is 712 which is slightly lower than the 2015 expected rate annual differences if any between the expected and actual returns on plan assets are included in unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss a component of other comprehensive income in calculating the annual amortization of the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss we use a marketrelated value of assets that smooths actual investment gains and losses on plan assets over a period up to five years the resulting unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss amount is recognized in net periodic pension expense over the average remaining life expectancy of the participant group since almost all participants are inactive the marketrelated value of our assets was 5433 million at december 31 2015 we do not expect our 2016 net periodic benefit cost which includes the effect of the marketrelated value of assets to be materially different than our 2015 cost see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for details on changes in the pension benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets effect if actual results differ from assumptions  we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that are used in our actuarial valuations adjusting our weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return 712 at december 31 2015 by 50 basis points would change our estimated pension expense in 2016 by approximately 27 million adjusting our weightedaverage discount rate 486 at december 31 2015 by 50 basis points would change our estimated pension expense in 2016 by approximately 04 million however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to changes in pension expense that could be material purchase accounting for acquisitions we account for acquisitions under accounting standards codification 805 business combinations which changed the application of the acquisition method of accounting in a business combination and also modified the way assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized on a prospective basis in general the acquisition method of accounting requires companies to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair market values at the date of acquisition we primarily estimate fair value of identified intangible assets using discounted cash flow analyses based on market participant based inputs any amount of the purchase price paid that is in excess of the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded in the line item goodwill in our consolidated balance sheets transaction costs as well as costs to reorganize acquired companies are expensed as incurred in our consolidated statements of income judgments and uncertainties  we consider accounting for business combinations critical because managements judgment is used to determine the estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed and amortization periods for intangible assets which can materially affect the our results of operations effect if actual results differ from assumptions  although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to an impairment charge if we are unable to recover the value of the recorded net assets49
