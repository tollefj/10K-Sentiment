franchise segment we manage hotels and timeshare properties and license our brands to franchisees this segment generates its revenue primarily from fees charged to hotel owners and to homeowners associations at timeshare properties we grow our management and franchise business by attracting owners to become a part of our system and participate in our brands and commercial services to support their hotel properties these contracts require little or no capital investment to initiate on our part and provide significant return on investment for us as fees are earnedhotel and timeshare managementour core management services consist of operating hotels under management agreements for the benefit of third parties who either own or lease the hotels and the associated personal property terms of our management agreements vary but our fees generally consist of a base management fee based on a percentage of each hotels gross revenue and we also may earn an incentive fee based on gross operating profits cash flow or a combination thereof in general the owner pays all operating and other expenses and reimburses our outofpocket expenses in turn our managerial discretion typically is subject to approval by the owner in certain major areas including the approval of annual operating and capital expenditure budgets additionally the owners generally pay a monthly program fee based on a percentage of the total gross room revenue that covers the costs of advertising and marketing programs internet technology and reservation systems expenses and quality assurance program costs as of december 31 2013 we managed 498 hotels with 143771 rooms excluding our owned and leased hotels the initial terms of our management agreements for fullservice hotels typically are 20 years in certain cases where we have entered into a franchise agreement as well as a management agreement we classify these hotels as managed hotels in our portfolio extension options for our management agreements are negotiated and vary but typically are more prevalent in fullservice hotels typically these agreements contain one or two extension options that are either for 5 or 10 years and can be exercised at our or the other partys option or by mutual agreement some of our management agreements provide early termination rights to hotel owners upon certain events including the failure to meet certain financial or performance criteria performance test measures typically are based upon the hotels performance individually andor in comparison to specified competitive hotels we often have a cure right by paying an amount equal to the performance shortfall over a specified period although in some cases our cure rights are limited in addition to the thirdparty owned hotels we manage we provide management services for 42 timeshare properties owned by homeowners associations and 155 owned leased and joint venture hotels from which we recognize management fee revenuesfranchisingwe franchise our brand names trade and service marks and operating systems to hotel owners under franchise agreements we do not directly participate in the daytoday management or operation of franchised hotels we conduct periodic inspections to ensure that brand standards are maintained and consult with franchisees concerning certain aspects of hotel operations we approve the location for new construction of franchised hotels as well as certain aspects of development in some cases we provide franchisees with product improvement plans that must be completed in accordance with brand standards to remain in our hotel system as of december 31 2013 there were 3420 franchised hotels with 466642 rooms each franchisee pays us a franchise application fee franchisees also pay a royalty fee generally based on a percentage of the hotels total gross room revenue and a percentage of food and beverage revenue in some brands as well as a monthly program fee based on a percentage of the total gross room revenue that covers the costs of advertising and marketing programs internet technology and reservation systems expenses and quality assurance program costs franchisees also are responsible for various other fees and charges including payments for participation in our hilton hhonors reward program training consultation and procurement of certain goods and services our franchise agreements typically have initial terms of approximately 20 years for new construction and approximately 10 to 20 years for properties that are converted from other brands at the expiration of the initial term we may relicense the hotel to the franchisee at our or the hotel owners option or by mutual agreement for an additional term ranging from 10 to 15 years we have the right to terminate a franchise agreement upon specified events of default including nonpayment of fees or noncompliance with brand standards if a franchise agreement is terminated by us because of a franchisees default the franchisee is contractually required to pay us liquidated damages8ownershipwe are among the largest hotel owners in the world based upon the number of rooms at our owned leased and joint venture hotels our diverse global portfolio of owned and leased properties includes a number of leading hotels in major gateway cities such as new york city london san francisco chicago são paolo sydney and tokyo the portfolio includes iconic hotels with significant underlying real estate value including the waldorf astoria new york the hilton hawaiian village and the london hilton on park lane real estate investment was a critical component of the growth of our business in our early years our real estate holdings grew over time through new construction purchases or leases of hotels investments in joint ventures and the acquisition of other hotel companies in recent years we have expanded our hotel system less through real estate investment and more by increasing the number of management and franchise agreements we have with thirdparty hotel ownerswe have focused on maximizing the cost efficiency and profitability of the portfolio by among other things implementing new labor management practices and systems and reducing fixed costs through our disciplined approach to asset management we have developed and executed on strategic plans for each of our hotels to enhance the market position of each property and at many of our hotels we have renovated guest rooms and public spaces and added or enhanced meeting and retail space to improve profitability at certain of our hotels we are evaluating options for the adaptive reuse of all or a portion of the property to residential retail or timeshare in order to deploy our real estate to its highest and best usetimeshareour timeshare segment generates revenue from three primary sourcestimeshare saleswe market and sell timeshare interests owned by hilton and third parties we also source timeshare intervals through sales and marketing agreements with thirdparty developers this allows us to sell timeshare units on behalf of thirdparty developers in exchange for sales marketing and branding fees on interval sales and to earn fees from resort operations and the servicing of consumer loans while deploying little upfront capital related to the construction of the propertyresort operationswe manage the hgv club receiving enrollment fees annual dues and transaction fees from member exchanges for other vacation products we generate rental revenue from unit rentals of unsold inventory and inventory made available due to ownership exchanges under our hgv club program we also earn revenue from retail and spa outlets at our timeshare propertiesfinancingwe provide consumer financing which includes interest income generated from the origination of consumer loans to customers to finance their purchase of timeshare intervals and revenue from servicing the loanshgvs primary product is a feesimple timeshare interest deeded in perpetuity this ownership interest is an interest in real estate equivalent to annual usage rights generally for one week at the timeshare resort where the timeshare interval was purchased each purchaser is automatically enrolled in the hgv club giving the purchaser an annual allotment of club points that allow the purchaser to exchange his or her annual usage rights for a number of options including a priority reservation period to stay at his or her home resort where his or her timeshare interval is deeded stays at any resort in the hgv system reservations for experiential travel such as cruises conversion to hilton hhonors points for stays at our hotels and other options including stays at more than 5000 resorts included in the rci timeshare vacation exchange network in addition we operate the hilton club which operates for owners of timeshare intervals at the hilton new york but whose members also enjoy exchange benefits with the hgv club as of december 31 2013 hgv managed a global system of 42 resorts and the hgv club and the hilton club had more than 212000 members in totalcompetitionwe encounter active and robust competition as a hotel residential resort and timeshare manager franchisor and developer competition in the hotel and lodging industry generally is based on the attractiveness of the facility location level of service quality of accommodations amenities food and beverage options and outlets public spaces and other guest services consistency of service room rate brand reputation and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points through a global system our properties and brands compete with other hotels resorts motels and inns in their respective geographic markets or customer segments including facilities owned by local interests individuals national and international chains institutions investment and pension funds and real estate investment trusts reits we believe that our position as a multibranded owner operator manager and franchisor of hotels makes us one of the largest and most geographically diverse lodging companies in the world 9our principal competitors include other branded and independent hotel operating companies national and international hotel brands and ownership companies including hotel reits while local and independent brand competitors vary on a global scale our primary competitors are firms such as accor sa carlson rezidor group fairmont raffles hotels international hong kong and shanghai hotels limited hyatt hotels corporation intercontinental hotel group marriott international mövenpick hotels and resorts starwood hotels amp resorts worldwide and wyndham worldwide corporationin the timeshare business we compete with other hotel and resort timeshare operators for sales of timeshare intervals based principally on location quality of accommodations price financing terms quality of service terms of property use and opportunity for timeshare owners to exchange into time at other timeshare properties or other travel rewards in addition we compete based on brand name recognition and reputation as well as with national and independent timeshare resale companies and owners reselling existing timeshare intervals which could reduce demand or prices for sales of new timeshare intervals our competitors in the timeshare space include hyatt residence club marriott vacations worldwide corp starwood vacation ownership and wyndham vacation resortsseasonalitythe hospitality industry is seasonal in nature the periods during which our lodging properties experience higher revenues vary from property to property depending principally upon location and the customerbase served we generally expect our revenues to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in each of the three subsequent quarters with the fourth quarter generally being the highestcyclicalitythe hospitality industry is cyclical and demand generally follows on a lagged basis key macroeconomic indicators there is a history of increases and decreases in demand for hotel rooms in occupancy levels and in room rates realized by owners of hotels through economic cycles the combination of changes in economic conditions and in the supply of hotel rooms can result in significant volatility in results for owners and managers of hotel properties the costs of running a hotel tend to be more fixed than variable as a result in an environment of declining revenues the rate of decline in earnings can be higher than the rate of decline in revenues the vacation ownership business also is cyclical as the demand for vacation ownership units is affected by the availability and cost of financing for purchases of vacation ownership units as well as general economic conditions and the relative health of the housing marketintellectual propertyin the highly competitive hospitality industry in which we operate trademarks service marks trade names logos and patents are very important to the success of our business we have a significant number of trademarks service marks trade names logos patents and pending registrations and expend significant resources each year on surveillance registration and
