we own a noncontrolling interest7management and franchisethrough our management and franchise segment we manage hotels and timeshare properties and license our brands to franchisees this segment generates its revenue primarily from fees charged to hotel owners and to homeowners associations at timeshare properties we grow our management and franchise business by attracting owners to become a part of our system and participate in our brands and commercial services to support their hotel properties these contracts require little or no capital investment to initiate on our part and provide significant return on investment for us as fees are earnedhotel and timeshare managementour core management services consist of operating hotels under management agreements for the benefit of third parties who either own or lease the hotels and the associated personal property terms of our management agreements vary but our fees generally consist of a base management fee based on a percentage of each hotels gross revenue and we also may earn an incentive fee based on gross operating profits cash flow or a combination thereof in general the owner pays all operating and other expenses and reimburses our outofpocket expenses in turn our managerial discretion typically is subject to approval by the owner in certain major areas including the approval of annual operating and capital expenditure budgets additionally the owners generally pay a monthly program fee based on a percentage of the total gross room revenue that covers the costs of advertising and marketing programs internet technology and reservation systems expenses and quality assurance program costs as of december 31 2013 we managed 498 hotels with 143771 rooms excluding our owned and leased hotels the initial terms of our management agreements for fullservice hotels typically are 20 years in certain cases where we have entered into a franchise agreement as well as a management agreement we classify these hotels as managed hotels in our portfolio extension options for our management agreements are negotiated and vary but typically are more prevalent in fullservice hotels typically these agreements contain one or two extension options that are either for 5 or 10 years and can be exercised at our or the other partys option or by mutual agreement some of our management agreements provide early termination rights to hotel owners upon certain events including the failure to meet certain financial or performance criteria performance test measures typically are based upon the hotels performance individually andor in comparison to specified competitive hotels we often have a cure right by paying an amount equal to the performance shortfall over a specified period although in some cases our cure rights are limited in addition to the thirdparty owned hotels we manage we provide management services for 42 timeshare properties owned by homeowners associations and 155 owned leased and joint venture hotels from which we recognize management fee revenuesfranchisingwe franchise our brand names trade and service marks and operating systems to hotel owners under franchise agreements we do not directly participate in the daytoday management or operation of franchised hotels we conduct periodic inspections to ensure that brand standards are maintained and consult with franchisees concerning certain aspects of hotel operations we approve the location for new construction of franchised hotels as well as certain aspects of development in some cases we provide franchisees with product improvement plans that must be completed in accordance with brand standards to remain in our hotel system as of december 31 2013 there were 3420 franchised hotels with 466642 rooms each franchisee pays us a franchise application fee franchisees also pay a royalty fee generally based on a percentage of the hotels total gross room revenue and a percentage of food and beverage revenue in some brands as well as a monthly program fee based on a percentage of the total gross room revenue that covers the costs of advertising and marketing programs internet technology and reservation systems expenses and quality assurance program costs franchisees also are responsible for various other fees and charges including payments for participation in our hilton hhonors reward program training consultation and procurement of certain goods and services our franchise agreements typically have initial terms of approximately 20 years for new construction and approximately 10 to 20 years for properties that are converted from other brands at the expiration of the initial term we may relicense the hotel to the franchisee at our or the hotel owners option or by mutual agreement for an additional term ranging from 10 to 15 years we have the right to terminate a franchise agreement upon specified events of default including nonpayment of fees or noncompliance with brand standards if a franchise agreement is terminated by us because of a franchisees default the franchisee is contractually required to pay us liquidated damages8ownershipwe are among the largest hotel owners in the world based upon the number of rooms at our owned leased and joint venture hotels our diverse global portfolio of owned and leased properties includes a number of leading hotels in major gateway cities such as new york city london san francisco chicago são paolo sydney and tokyo the portfolio includes iconic hotels with significant underlying real estate value including the waldorf astoria new york the hilton hawaiian village and the london hilton on park lane real estate investment was a critical component of the growth of our business in our early years our real estate holdings grew over time through new construction purchases or leases of hotels investments in joint ventures and the acquisition of other hotel companies in recent years we have expanded our hotel system less through real estate investment and more by increasing the number of management and franchise agreements we have with thirdparty hotel ownerswe have focused on maximizing the cost efficiency and profitability of the portfolio by among other things implementing new labor management practices and systems and reducing fixed costs through our disciplined approach to asset management we have developed and executed on strategic plans for each of our hotels to enhance the market position of each property and at many of our hotels we have renovated guest rooms and public spaces and added or enhanced meeting and retail space to improve profitability at certain of our hotels we are evaluating options for the adaptive reuse of all or a portion of the property to residential retail or timeshare in order to deploy our real estate to its highest and best usetimeshareour timeshare segment generates revenue from three primary sourcestimeshare saleswe market and sell timeshare interests owned by hilton and third parties we also source timeshare intervals through sales and marketing agreements with thirdparty developers this allows us to sell timeshare units on behalf of thirdparty developers in exchange for sales marketing and branding fees on interval sales and to earn fees from resort operations and the servicing of consumer loans while deploying little upfront capital related to the construction of the propertyresort operationswe manage the hgv club receiving enrollment fees annual dues and transaction fees from member exchanges for other vacation products we generate rental revenue from unit rentals of unsold inventory and inventory made available due to ownership exchanges under our hgv club program we also earn revenue from retail and spa outlets at our timeshare propertiesfinancingwe provide consumer financing which includes interest income generated from the origination of consumer loans to customers to finance their purchase of timeshare intervals and revenue from servicing the loanshgvs primary product is a feesimple timeshare interest deeded in perpetuity this ownership interest is an interest in real estate equivalent to annual usage rights generally for one week at the timeshare resort where the timeshare interval was purchased each purchaser is automatically enrolled in the hgv club giving the purchaser an annual allotment of club points that allow the purchaser to exchange his or her annual usage rights for a number of options including a priority reservation period to stay at his or her home resort where his or her timeshare interval is deeded stays at any resort in the hgv system reservations for experiential travel such as cruises conversion to hilton hhonors points for stays at our hotels and other options including stays at more than 5000 resorts included in the rci timeshare vacation exchange network in addition we operate the hilton club which operates for owners of timeshare intervals at the hilton new york but whose members also enjoy exchange benefits with the hgv club as of december 31 2013 hgv managed a global system of 42 resorts and the hgv club and the hilton club had more than 212000 members in totalcompetitionwe encounter active and robust competition as a hotel residential resort and timeshare manager franchisor and developer competition in the hotel and lodging industry generally is based on the attractiveness of the facility location level of service quality of accommodations amenities food and beverage options and outlets public spaces and other guest services consistency of service room rate brand reputation and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points through a global system our properties and brands compete with other hotels resorts motels and inns in their respective geographic markets or customer segments including facilities owned by local interests individuals national and international chains institutions investment and pension funds and real estate investment trusts reits we believe that our position as a multibranded owner operator manager and franchisor of hotels makes us one of the largest and most geographically diverse lodging companies in the world 9our principal competitors include other branded and independent hotel operating companies national and international hotel brands and ownership companies including hotel reits while local and independent brand competitors vary on a global scale our primary competitors are firms such as accor sa carlson rezidor group fairmont raffles hotels international hong kong and shanghai hotels limited hyatt hotels corporation intercontinental hotel group marriott international mövenpick hotels and resorts starwood hotels amp resorts worldwide and wyndham worldwide corporationin the timeshare business we compete with other hotel and resort timeshare operators for sales of timeshare intervals based principally on location quality of accommodations price financing terms quality of service terms of property use and opportunity for timeshare owners to exchange into time at other timeshare properties or other travel rewards in addition we compete based on brand name recognition and reputation as well as with national and independent timeshare resale companies and owners reselling existing timeshare intervals which could reduce demand or prices for sales of new timeshare intervals our competitors in the timeshare space include hyatt residence club marriott vacations worldwide corp starwood vacation ownership and wyndham vacation resortsseasonalitythe hospitality industry is seasonal in nature the periods during which our lodging properties experience higher revenues vary from property to property depending principally upon location and the customerbase served we generally expect our revenues to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in each of the three subsequent quarters with the fourth quarter generally being the highestcyclicalitythe hospitality industry is cyclical and demand generally follows on a lagged basis key macroeconomic indicators there is a history of increases and decreases in demand for hotel rooms in occupancy levels and in room rates realized by owners of hotels through economic cycles the combination of changes in economic conditions and in the supply of hotel rooms can result in significant volatility in results for owners and managers of hotel properties the costs of running a hotel tend to be more fixed than variable as a result in an environment of declining revenues the rate of decline in earnings can be higher than the rate of decline in revenues the vacation ownership business also is cyclical as the demand for vacation ownership units is affected by the availability and cost of financing for purchases of vacation ownership units as well as general economic conditions and the relative health of the housing marketintellectual propertyin the highly competitive hospitality industry in which we operate trademarks service marks trade names logos and patents are very important to the success of our business we have a significant number of trademarks

global or regional demand for hospitality products and services can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or low levels of economic growth and the recovery period in our industry may lag overall economic improvement declines in demand for our products and services due to general economic conditions could negatively affect our business by decreasing the revenues and profitability of our owned properties limiting the amount of fee revenues we are able to generate from our managed and franchised properties and reducing overall demand for timeshare intervals in addition many of the expenses associated with our business including personnel costs interest rent property taxes insurance and utilities are relatively fixed during a period of overall economic weakness if we are unable to meaningfully decrease these costs as demand for our hotels and timeshare properties decreases our business operations and financial performance may be adversely affected  the hospitality industry is subject to seasonal and cyclical volatility which may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations and financial condition the hospitality industry is seasonal in nature the periods during which our lodging properties experience higher revenues vary from property to property depending principally upon location and the customer base served we generally expect our revenues to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in each of the three subsequent quarters with the fourth quarter generally being the highest in addition the hospitality industry is cyclical and demand generally follows on a lagged basis the general economy the seasonality and cyclicality of our industry may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations and financial condition because we operate in a highly competitive industry our revenues or profits could be harmed if we are unable to compete effectively the segments of the hospitality industry in which we operate are subject to intense competition our principal competitors are other operators of luxury fullservice and focusedservice and timeshare properties including other major hospitality chains with wellestablished and recognized brands we also compete against smaller hotel chains independent and local hotel owners and operators and independent timeshare operators if we are unable to compete successfully our revenues or profits may decline competition for hotel guests we face competition for individual guests group reservations and conference business we compete for these customers based primarily on brand name recognition and reputation as well as location room rates property size and availability of rooms and conference space quality of the accommodations customer satisfaction amenities and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points our competitors may have greater financial and marketing resources and more efficient technology platforms which could allow them to improve their properties and expand and improve their marketing efforts in ways that could affect our ability to compete for guests effectively competition for management and franchise agreements we compete to enter into management and franchise agreements our ability to compete effectively is based primarily on the value and quality of our management services brand name recognition and reputation our ability and willingness to invest capital availability of suitable properties in certain geographic areas and the overall economic terms of our agreements and the economic advantages to the property owner of retaining our management services and using our brands if the properties that we manage or franchise perform less successfully than those of our competitors if we are unable to offer terms as favorable as those offered by our competitors or if the availability of suitable properties is limited our ability to compete effectively for new management or franchise agreements could be reduced 14competition for sales of timeshare properties we compete with other timeshare operators for sales of timeshare intervals based principally on location quality of accommodations price financing terms quality of service terms of property use opportunity for timeshare owners to exchange into time at other timeshare properties or other travel rewards as well as brand name recognition and reputation our ability to attract and retain purchasers of timeshare intervals depends on our success in distinguishing the quality and value of our timeshare offerings from those offered by others if we are unable to do so our ability to compete effectively for sales of timeshare intervals could be adversely affected  any deterioration in the quality or reputation of our brands could have an adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition or results of operations our brands and our reputation are among our most important assets our ability to attract and retain guests depends in part on the public recognition of our brands and their associated reputation in addition the success of our hotel owners businesses and their ability to make payments to us may indirectly depend on the strength and reputation of our brands such dependence makes our business susceptible to risks regarding brand obsolescence and to reputational damage if our brands become obsolete or are viewed as unfashionable or lacking in consistency and quality we may be unable to attract guests to our hotels and further we may be unable to attract or retain our hotel owners in addition many factors can negatively affect the reputation of any individual brand or the overall brand of our company changes in ownership or management practices the occurrence of accidents or injuries natural disasters crime individual guest notoriety or similar events can have a substantial negative effect on our reputation create adverse publicity and cause a loss of consumer confidence in our business because of the global nature of our brands and the broad expanse of our business and hotel locations events occurring in one location could have a resulting negative effect on the reputation and operations of otherwise successful individual locations in addition the considerable expansion in the use of social media over recent years has compounded the potential scope of the negative publicity that could be generated by such incidents we could also face legal claims related to these events along with adverse publicity resulting from such litigation if the perceived quality of our brands declines or if our reputation is damaged our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain good relationships with thirdparty hotel owners and renew or enter into new management and franchise agreements we may be unable to expand our presence and our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer our management and franchise business depends on our ability to establish and maintain longterm positive relationships with thirdparty property owners and on our ability to renew existing and enter into new management and franchise agreements the management and franchise contracts we enter into with thirdparty owners are typically longterm arrangements but may allow the hotel owner to terminate the agreement under certain circumstances including in certain cases the failure to meet certain financial or performance criteria our ability to meet these financial and performance criteria is subject to among other things risks common to the overall hotel industry including factors outside of our control in addition any negative management and franchise pricing trends could adversely affect our ability to negotiate with hotel owners if we fail to maintain and renew existing management and franchise agreements and enter into new agreements on favorable terms we may be unable to expand our presence and our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer our management and franchise business is subject to real estate investment risks for thirdparty owners that could adversely affect our operational results and our prospects for growth the ability to grow our management and franchise business is subject to the range of risks associated with real estate investments our ability to sustain continued growth through management and franchise agreements for new hotels and the conversion of existing facilities to managed or franchised branded hotels is affected and may potentially be limited by a variety of factors influencing real estate development generally these include site availability the availability of financing planning zoning and other local approvals other limitations that may be imposed by market factors include projected room occupancy changes in growth in demand compared to projected supply geographic area restrictions in management and franchise agreements costs of construction and anticipated room rate structure any inability by us or our thirdparty owners to manage these factors effectively could adversely affect our operational results and our prospects for growth  15if our thirdparty property owners are unable to repay or refinance loans secured by the mortgaged properties or to obtain financing adequate to fund current operations or growth plans our revenues profits and capital resources could be reduced and our business could be harmed many of the properties owned by our thirdparty property owners are pledged as collateral for mortgage loans entered into when such properties were purchased or refinanced by them if our thirdparty property owners are unable to repay or refinance maturing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all their lenders could declare a default accelerate the related debt and repossess the property any such repossessions could result in the termination of our management and franchise agreements or eliminate revenues and cash flows from such property which could negatively affect our business and results of operations in addition the owners of managed and franchised hotels depend on financing to buy develop and improve hotels and in some cases fund operations during down cycles our hotel owners inability to obtain adequate funding could materially adversely affect the maintenance and improvement plans with respect to existing hotels as well as result in the delay or stoppage of the development of our existing pipeline if thirdparty property owners fail to make investments necessary to maintain or improve their properties guest preference for hilton brands and reputation and performance results could suffer substantially all of our management and franchise agreements require thirdparty property owners to comply with standards that are essential to maintaining the quality and reputation of our branded hotel properties this includes requirements related to the physical condition safety standards and appearance of the properties as well as the service levels provided by employees these standards may evolve with customer preference or we may introduce new requirements and team members over time if our property owners fail to make investments necessary to maintain or improve the properties in accordance with such standards guest preference for our brands could diminish and this could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition if thirdparty property owners fail to observe standards and meet their contractual requirements we may elect to exercise our termination rights which would eliminate revenues from these properties and cause us to incur expenses related to terminating these relationships we may be unable to find suitable or offsetting replacements for any terminated relationships contractual and other disagreements with thirdparty property owners could make us liable to them or result in litigation costs or other expenses our management and franchise agreements require us and our hotel owners to comply with operational and performance conditions that are subject to interpretation and could result in disagreements at any given time we may be in disputes with one or more of our hotel owners any such dispute could be very expensive for us even if the outcome is ultimately in our favor we cannot predict the outcome of any arbitration or litigation the effect of any negative judgment against us or the amount of any settlement that we may enter into with any thirdparty an adverse result in any of these proceedings could materially adversely affect our results of operations furthermore specific to our industry some courts have applied principles of agency law and related fiduciary standards to managers of thirdparty hotel properties which means that property owners may assert the right to terminate agreements even where the agreements do not expressly provide for termination in the event of any such termination our fees from such properties would be eliminated and accordingly may negatively affect our results of operations we are exposed to the risks resulting from significant investments in owned and leased real estate which could increase our costs reduce our profits and limit our ability to respond to market conditions we own or lease a substantial amount of real property as one of our three business segments real estate ownership and leasing is subject to various risks that may or may not be applicable to managed or franchised properties including governmental regulations relating to real estate ownership or operations including tax environmental zoning and eminent domain laws  changes in market conditions or the area in which real estate is located losing value differences in potential civil liability between owners and operators for accidents or other occurrences on owned or leased properties the ongoing need for ownerfunded capital improvements and expenditures to maintain or upgrade properties periodic total or partial closures due to renovations and facility improvements 16risks associated with mortgage debt including the possibility of default fluctuating interest rate levels and uncertainties in the availability of replacement financing fluctuations in real estate values or potential impairments in the value of our assets and the relative illiquidity of real estate compared to some other assets the negative effect on profitability and cash flow from declines in revenues is more pronounced in owned properties because we as the owner bear the risk of their high fixedcost structure further during times of economic distress declining demand and declining earnings often result in declining asset values and we may not be able to sell properties on favorable terms or at all accordingly we may not be able to adjust our owned property portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions our efforts to develop redevelop or renovate our owned and leased properties could be delayed or become more expensive which could reduce revenues or impair our ability to compete effectively certain of our owned and leased properties were constructed more than a century ago the condition of aging properties could negatively affect our ability to attract guests or result in higher operating and capital costs either of which could reduce revenues or profits from these properties while we have budgeted for replacements and repairs to furniture fixtures and hotel equipment at our properties there can be no assurance that these replacements and repairs will occur or even if completed will result in improved performance in addition these efforts are subject to a number of risks including construction delays or cost overruns including labor and materials that may increase project costs obtaining zoning occupancy and other required permits or authorizations changes in economic conditions that may result in weakened or lack of demand or negative project returns governmental restrictions on the size or kind of development volatility in the debt and capital markets that may limit our ability to raise capital for projects or improvements lack of availability of rooms or meeting spaces for revenuegenerating activities during construction modernization or renovation projects force majeure events including earthquakes tornadoes hurricanes floods or tsunamis and design defects that could increase costs if our properties are not updated to meet guest preferences if properties under development or renovation are delayed in opening as scheduled or if renovation investments adversely affect or fail to improve performance our operations and financial results could be negatively affected our properties may not be permitted to be rebuilt if destroyed certain of our properties may qualify as legallypermissible nonconforming uses and improvements including certain of our iconic and most profitable properties if a substantial portion of any such properties were to be destroyed by fire or other casualty we might not be permitted to rebuild that property as it now exists regardless of the availability of insurance proceeds any loss of this nature whether insured or not could materially adversely affect our results of operations and prospects we share control in joint venture projects which limits our ability to manage thirdparty risks associated with these projects joint venturers often have shared control over the operation of our joint venture assets in most cases we are minority participants and do not control the decisions of the ventures therefore joint venture investments may involve risks such as the possibility that a coventurer in an investment might become bankrupt be unable to meet its capital contribution obligations have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals or take actions that are contrary to our instructions or to applicable laws and regulations in addition we may be unable to take action without the 17approval of our joint venture partners or our joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without our consent consequently actions by a coventurer or other thirdparty could expose us to claims for damages financial penalties and reputational harm any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and operations in addition we may agree to guarantee indebtedness incurred by a joint venture or coventurer or provide standard indemnifications to lenders for loss liability or damage occurring as a result of our actions or actions of the joint venture or other coventurers such a guarantee or indemnity may be on a joint and several basis with a coventurer in which case we may be liable in the event such coventurer defaults on its guarantee obligation the nonperformance of such obligations may cause losses to us in excess of the capital we initially may have invested or committed under such obligations preparing our financial statements requires us to have access to information regarding the results of operations financial position and cash flows of our joint ventures any deficiencies in our joint ventures internal controls over financial reporting may affect our ability to report our financial results accurately or prevent or detect fraud such deficiencies also could result in restatements of or other adjustments to our previously reported or announced operating results which could diminish investor confidence and reduce the market price for our shares additionally if our joint ventures are unable to provide this information for any meaningful period or fail to meet expected deadlines we may be unable to satisfy our financial reporting obligations or timely file our periodic reports although our joint ventures may generate positive cash flow in some cases they may be unable to distribute that cash to the joint venture partners additionally in some cases our joint venture partners control distributions and may choose to leave capital in the joint venture rather than distribute it because our ability to generate liquidity from our joint ventures depends in part on their ability to distribute capital to us our failure to receive distributions from our joint venture partners could reduce our return on these investments the timeshare business is subject to extensive regulation and failure to comply with such regulation may have an adverse effect on our business we develop manage market and sell timeshare intervals certain of these activities are subject to extensive state regulation in both the state in which the timeshare property is located and the states in which the timeshare property is marketed and sold federal regulation of certain marketing practices also applies in addition we provide financing to some purchasers of timeshare intervals and we also service the resulting loans this practice subjects us to various federal and state regulations including those which require disclosure to borrowers regarding the terms of their loans as well as settlement servicing and collection of loans if we fail to comply with applicable federal state and local laws in connection with our timeshare business we may not be able to offer timeshare intervals or associated financing in certain areas and as a result the timeshare business could suffer a decline in revenues  a decline in timeshare interval inventory or our failure to enter into and maintain timeshare management agreements may have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations in addition to timeshare interval inventory from our owned timeshare properties we source inventory through sales and marketing agreements with thirdparty developers if we fail to develop timeshare properties or are unsuccessful in entering into new agreements with thirdparty developers we may experience a decline in timeshare interval inventory available to be sold by us which could result in a decrease in our revenues in addition a decline in timeshare interval inventory could result in both a decrease of financing revenues that are generated from purchasers of timeshare intervals and fee revenues that are generated by providing management services to the timeshare properties if purchasers default on the loans that we provide to finance their purchases of timeshare intervals the revenues and profits that we derive from the timeshare business could be reduced providing secured financing to some purchasers of timeshare intervals subjects us to the risk of purchaser default as of december 31 2013 we had approximately 994 million of timeshare financing receivables outstanding if a purchaser defaults under the financing that we provide we could be forced to write off the loan and reclaim ownership of the timeshare interval through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure if the timeshare interval has declined in value we may incur impairment losses that reduce our profits in addition we may be unable to resell the property in a timely manner or at the same price or at all also if a purchaser of a timeshare interval defaults on the related loan during the early part of the amortization period we may not have recovered the marketing selling and general and administrative costs associated with the sale of that timeshare interval if we are unable to recover any of the principal amount of the loan from a defaulting purchaser or if the allowances for losses from such defaults are inadequate the revenues and profits that we derive from the timeshare business could be reduced 18some of our existing development pipeline may not be developed into new hotels which could materially adversely affect our growth prospects as of december 31 2013 we had a total of 1123 hotels in our development pipeline which we define as hotels under construction or approved for development under one of our brands the commitments of owners and developers with whom we have agreements are subject to numerous conditions and the eventual development and construction of our pipeline not currently under construction is subject to numerous risks including in certain cases obtaining governmental and regulatory approvals and adequate financing as a result our entire development pipeline may not develop into new hotelsnew hotel brands or nonhotel branded concepts that we launch in the future may not be as successful as we anticipate which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations we have launched several new brand concepts over the last few years we opened our first home2 suites by hilton hotel in 2011 launched the eforea spa at hilton brand in 2010 and opened the first herb n kitchen restaurant in 2013 we may continue to build our portfolio of branded hotel products and nonhotel branded concepts by launching new hotel and nonhotel brands in the future in addition the hilton garden inn doubletree by hilton and hampton by hilton brands have been expanding into new jurisdictions outside the united states in recent years we may continue to expand existing brands into new international markets new hotel products or concepts or brand expansions may not be accepted by hotel owners franchisees or customers and we cannot guarantee the level of acceptance any new brands will have in the development and consumer marketplaces if new branded hotel products nonhotel branded concepts or brand expansions are not as successful as we anticipate we may not recover the costs we incurred in developing or expanding such brands and this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations failures in material damage to or interruptions in our information technology systems software or websites and difficulties in updating our existing software or developing or implementing new software could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations we depend heavily upon our information technology systems in the conduct of our business we own and license or otherwise contract for sophisticated technology and systems for property management procurement reservations and the operation of the hilton hhonors customer loyalty program such systems are subject to among other things damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses and natural and manmade disasters in addition substantially all of our data center operations are currently located in a single facility and any loss or damage to the facility could result in operational disruption and data loss damage or interruption to our information systems may require a significant investment to update remediate or replace with alternate systems and we may suffer interruptions in our operations as a result in addition costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations any material interruptions or failures in our systems including those that may result from our failure to adequately develop implement and maintain a robust disaster recovery plan and backup systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial performance we rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology functions worldwide and the provision of information technology and business process services in particular our reservation system relies on data communications networks operated by unaffiliated third parties the success of our business depends in part on maintaining our relationships with these third parties and their continuing ability to perform these functions and services in a timely and satisfactory manner if we experience a loss or disruption in the provision of any of these functions or services or they are not performed in a satisfactory manner we may have difficulty in finding alternate providers on terms favorable to us in a timely manner or at all and our business could be adversely affected we rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that they can continue to support our business the software programs supporting many of our systems were licensed to us by independent software developers the inability of these developers or us to continue to maintain and upgrade these information systems and software programs would disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations if we were unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner we are vulnerable to various risks and uncertainties associated with our websites and mobile applications including changes in required technology interfaces website and mobile application downtime and other technical failures costs and issues as we upgrade our website software and mobile applications additional risks include computer viruses changes in applicable federal and state regulation security breaches legal claims related to our website operations and ecommerce 19fulfillment and other consumer privacy concerns our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties could reduce website and mobile application sales and have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operationscyberattacks could have a disruptive effect on our businessfrom time to time we and third parties who serve us experience cyberattacks attempted breaches of our or their information technology systems and networks or similar events which could result in a loss of sensitive business or customer information systems interruption or the disruption of our operations for example in 2011 we were notified by epsilon our database marketing vendor that we were among a group of companies served by epsilon that were affected by a data breach that resulted in an unauthorized third party gaining access to epsilons files that included names and emails of certain of our customers even if we are fully compliant with legal standards and contractual requirements we still may not be able to prevent security breaches involving sensitive data the sophistication of efforts by hackers to gain unauthorized access to information systems has increased in recent years any breach theft loss or fraudulent use of customer employee or company data could cause consumers to lose confidence in the security of our websites mobile applications and other information technology systems and choose not to purchase from us any such security breach could expose us to risks of data loss business disruption litigation and other liability any of which could adversely affect our businesswe may be exposed to risks and costs associated with protecting the integrity and security of our guests personal information we are subject to various risks associated with the collection handling storage and transmission of sensitive information including risks related to compliance with us and foreign data collection and privacy laws and other contractual obligations as well as the risk that our systems collecting such information could be compromised in the course of doing business we collect large volumes of internal and customer data including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information for various business purposes including managing our workforce providing requested products and services and maintaining guest preferences to enhance customer service and for marketing and promotion purposes our various information technology systems enter process summarize and report such data if we fail to maintain compliance with the various us and foreign data collection and privacy laws or with credit card industry standards or other applicable data security standards we could be exposed to fines penalties restrictions litigation or other expenses and our business could be adversely affected  in addition states and the federal government have recently enacted additional laws and regulations to protect consumers against identity theft these laws and similar laws in other jurisdictions have increased the costs of doing business and if we fail to implement appropriate safeguards or we fail to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these laws we could be subject to potential claims for damages and other remedies if we were required to pay any significant amounts in satisfaction of claims under these laws or if we were forced to cease our business operations for any length of time as a result of our inability to comply fully with any such law our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected we may seek to expand through acquisitions of and investments in other businesses and properties or through alliances and we may also seek to divest some of our properties and other assets these acquisition and disposition activities may be unsuccessful or divert managements attention we may consider strategic and complementary acquisitions of and investments in other hotel or hospitality brands businesses properties or other assets furthermore we may pursue these opportunities in alliance with existing or prospective owners of managed or franchised properties in many cases we will be competing for these opportunities with third parties that may have substantially greater financial resources than us acquisitions or investments in brands businesses properties or assets as well as these alliances are subject to risks that could affect our business including risks related to issuing shares of stock that could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders spending cash and incurring debt assuming contingent liabilities or creating additional expenses 20we may not be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all or we may not actually realize any anticipated benefits from such acquisitions investments or alliances similarly we may not be able to obtain financing for acquisitions or investments on attractive terms or at all or the ability to obtain financing may not be restricted by the terms of our indebtedness in addition the success of any acquisitions or investments also will depend in part on our ability to integrate the acquisition or investment with our existing operations we may also divest certain properties or assets and any such divestments may yield lower than expected returns in some circumstances sales of properties or other assets may result in losses upon a sale of properties or assets we may become subject to contractual indemnity obligations incur material tax liabilities or as a result of required debt repayment face a shortage of liquidity finally any acquisitions investments or dispositions could demand significant attention from management that would otherwise be available for business operations which could harm our business failure to keep pace with developments in technology could adversely affect our operations or competitive position the hospitality industry demands the use of sophisticated technology and systems for property management brand assurance and compliance procurement reservation systems operation of our customer loyalty programs distribution of hotel resources to current and future customers and guest amenities these technologies may require refinements and upgrades the development and maintenance of these technologies may require significant investment by us as various systems and technologies become outdated or new technology is required we may not be able to replace or introduce them as quickly as needed or in a costeffective and timely manner we may not achieve the benefits we may have been anticipating from any new technology or system failure to comply with marketing and advertising laws including with regard to direct marketing could result in fines or place restrictions on our business we rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques including telemarketing email marketing and postal mailings and we are subject to various laws and regulations in the us and internationally which govern marketing and advertising practices any further restrictions in laws such as the telephone consumer protection act of 1991 the telemarketing sales rule canspam act of 2003 and various us state laws new laws or international data protection laws such as the eu member states implementation of proposed privacy regulation that govern these activities could adversely affect current or planned marketing activities and cause us to change our marketing strategy if this occurs we may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies which could affect our ability to maintain relationships with our customers and acquire new customers we also obtain access to names of potential customers from travel service providers or other companies and we market to some individuals on these lists directly or through other companies marketing materials if access to these lists was prohibited or otherwise restricted our ability to develop new customers and introduce them to products could be impaired the growth of internet reservation channels could adversely affect our business and profitability a significant percentage of hotel rooms for individual guests is booked through internet travel intermediaries we contract with such intermediaries and pay them various commissions and transaction fees for sales of our rooms through their systems if such bookings increase these intermediaries may be able to obtain higher commissions reduced room rates or other significant concessions from us or our franchisees although we have established agreements with many of these intermediaries that limit transaction fees for hotels there can be no assurance that we will be able to renegotiate these agreements upon their expiration with terms as favorable as the provisions that existed before the expiration replacement or renegotiation moreover hospitality intermediaries generally employ aggressive marketing strategies including expending significant resources for online and television advertising campaigns to drive consumers to their websites as a result consumers may develop brand loyalties to the intermediaries offered brands websites and reservations systems rather than to the hilton brands and systems if this happens our business and profitability may be significantly affected as shifting customer loyalties divert bookings away from our websites in addition in general internet travel intermediaries have traditionally competed to attract individual consumers or transient business rather than group and convention business however hospitality intermediaries have recently grown their business to include marketing to large group and convention business if that growth continues it could both divert group and convention business away from our hotels and it could also increase our cost of sales for group and convention business recent class action litigation against several online travel intermediaries and lodging companies including hilton challenges the legality under certain antitrust laws of certain provisions in contracts and alleged practices with thirdparty intermediaries while we are vigorously defending the litigation and believe the contract provisions are lawful the courts will 21ultimately determine this issue our fees and expenses associated with this litigation even if we ultimately prevail could be material any adverse outcome could require us to alter our business arrangements with these intermediaries and consequently could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations our reservation system is an important component of our business operations and a disruption to its functioning could have an adverse effect on our performance and results we manage a global reservation system that communicates reservations to our branded hotels when made by individuals directly either online or by telephone to our call centers or through intermediaries like travel agents internet travel web sites and other distribution channels the cost speed efficacy and efficiency of the reservation system are important aspects of our business and are important considerations of hotel owners in choosing to affiliate with our brands any failure to maintain or upgrade and any other disruption to our reservation system may adversely affect our business the cessation reduction or taxation of program benefits of our hilton hhonors loyalty program could adversely affect the hilton brands and guest loyalty we manage the hilton hhonors guest loyalty and rewards program for the hilton brands program members accumulate points based on eligible stays and hotel charges and redeem the points for a range of benefits including free rooms and other items of value the program is an important aspect of our business and of the affiliation value for hotel owners under management and franchise agreements system hotels including without limitation thirdparty hotels under management and franchise arrangements contribute a percentage of the guests charges to the program for each stay of a program member in addition to the accumulation of points for future hotels stays at our brands hilton hhonors arranges with thirdparty service providers such as airlines and rail companies to exchange monetary value represented by points for program awards currently the program benefits are not taxed as income to members if the program awards and benefits are materially altered curtailed or taxed such that a material number of hhonors members choose to no longer participate in the program this could adversely affect our business because we derive a portion of our revenues from operations outside the united states the risks of doing business internationally could lower our revenues increase our costs reduce our profits or disrupt our business we currently manage franchise own or lease hotels and resorts in 91 countries around the world our operations outside the united states represented approximately 25 percent and 27 percent of our revenues for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively we expect that revenues from our international operations will continue to account for an increasing portion of our total revenues as a result we are subject to the risks of doing business outside the united states including rapid changes in governmental economic and political policy political or civil unrest acts of terrorism or the threat of international boycotts or us antiboycott legislation increases in antiamerican sentiment and the identification of the licensed brands as an american brand recessionary trends or economic instability in international markets changes in foreign currency exchange rates or currency restructurings and hyperinflation or deflation in the countries in which we operate the effect of disruptions caused by severe weather natural disasters outbreak of disease or other events that make travel to a particular region less attractive or more difficult the presence and acceptance of varying levels of business corruption in international markets and the effect of various anticorruption and other laws  the imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds or limitations on our ability to repatriate nonus earnings in a taxefficient manner the ability to comply with or effect of complying with complex and changing laws regulations and policies of foreign governments that may affect investments or operations including foreign ownership restrictions import and export controls tariffs embargoes increases in taxes paid and other changes in applicable tax laws 22uncertainties as to local laws and enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights forced nationalization of our properties by local state or national governments and the difficulties involved in managing an organization doing business in many different countries these factors may adversely affect the revenues from and the market value of our properties located in international markets while these factors and the effect of these factors are difficult to predict any one or more of them could lower our revenues increase our costs reduce our profits or disrupt our business operations failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our international operations may increase costs reduce profits limit growth or subject us to broader liability our business operations in countries outside the us are subject to a number of laws and regulations including restrictions imposed by the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa as well as trade sanctions administered by the office of foreign assets control ofac the fcpa is intended to prohibit bribery of foreign officials and requires companies whose securities are listed in the us to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect those companies transactions and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls ofac administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on us foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign states organizations and individuals we have policies in place designed to comply with applicable sanctions rules and regulations given the nature of our business it is possible that hotels we own or manage in the countries and territories in which we operate may provide services to persons subject to sanctions where we have identified potential violations in the past we have taken appropriate remedial action including filing voluntary disclosures to ofac in addition some of our operations may be subject to the laws and regulations of nonus jurisdictions including the uks bribery act 2010 which contains significant prohibitions on bribery and other corrupt business activities and other local anticorruption laws in the countries in which we conduct operations if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could be exposed to claims for damages financial penalties reputational harm and incarceration of employees or restrictions on our operation or ownership of hotels and other properties including the termination of management franchising and ownership rights in addition in certain circumstances the actions of parties affiliated with us including our owners joint venture partners team members and agents may expose us to liability under the fcpa us sanctions or other laws these restrictions could increase costs of operations reduce profits or cause us to forgo development opportunities that would otherwise support growth in august 2012 congress enacted the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 itrshra which expands the scope of us sanctions against iran and syria in particular section 219 of the itrshra amended the exchange act to require companies subject to sec reporting obligations under section 13 of the exchange act to disclose in their periodic reports specified dealings or transactions involving iran or other individuals and entities targeted by certain ofac sanctions engaged in by the reporting company or any of its affiliates during the period covered by the relevant periodic report in some cases itrshra requires companies to disclose these types of transactions even if they would otherwise be permissible under us law these companies are required to separately file with the sec a notice that such activities have been disclosed in the relevant periodic report and the sec is required to post this notice of disclosure on its website and send the report to the us president and certain us congressional committees the us president thereafter is required to initiate an investigation and within 180 days of initiating such an investigation with respect to certain disclosed activities to determine whether sanctions should be imposed under itrshra we are required to report if we or any of our affiliates knowingly engaged in certain specified activities during a period covered by one of our annual reports on form 10k or quarterly reports on form 10q we have engaged in and may in the future engage in activities that would require disclosure pursuant to section 219 of itrshra including the activities discussed in the disclosures included on exhibit 991 to this annual report on form 10k which disclosures are hereby incorporated by reference herein in addition because the sec defines the term affiliate broadly it includes any entity controlled by us as well as any person or entity that controls us or is under common control with us because we may be deemed to be a controlled affiliate of blackstone affiliates of blackstone may also be considered our affiliates other affiliates of blackstone have in the past and may in the future be required to make disclosures pursuant to itrshra disclosure of such activities even if such activities are permissible under applicable law and any sanctions imposed on us or our affiliates as a result of these activities could harm our reputation and brands and have a negative impact on our results of operations 23the loss of senior executives or key field personnel such as general managers could significantly harm our business our ability to maintain our competitive position depends somewhat on the efforts and abilities of our senior executives finding suitable replacements for senior executives could be difficult losing the services of one or more of these senior executives could adversely affect strategic relationships including relationships with thirdparty property owners joint venture partners and vendors and limit our ability to execute our business strategies we also rely on the general managers at each of our managed owned leased and joint venture hotels to manage daily operations and oversee the efforts of team members these general managers are trained professionals in the hospitality industry and have extensive experience in many markets worldwide the failure to retain train or successfully manage general managers for our managed owned leased and joint venture hotels could negatively affect our operations collective bargaining activity could disrupt our operations increase our labor costs or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies a significant number of our employees approximately 26 percent and employees of our hotel owners are covered by collective bargaining agreements and similar agreements if relationships with our employees or employees of our hotel owners or the unions that represent them become adverse the properties we manage franchise own or lease could experience labor disruptions such as strikes lockouts boycotts and public demonstrations a number of our collective bargaining agreements representing approximately 17 percent of our organized employees have expired and are in the process of being renegotiated and we may be required to negotiate additional collective bargaining agreements in the future if more employees become unionized labor disputes which may be more likely when collective bargaining agreements are being negotiated could harm our relationship with our employees or employees of our hotel owners result in increased regulatory inquiries and enforcement by governmental authorities and deter guests further adverse publicity related to a labor dispute could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services labor regulation and the negotiation of new or existing collective bargaining agreements could lead to higher wage and benefit costs changes in work rules that raise operating expenses legal costs and limitations on our ability or the ability of our thirdparty property owners to take cost saving measures during economic downturns we do not have the ability to control the negotiations of collective bargaining agreements covering unionized labor employed by many thirdparty property owners increased unionization of our workforce new labor legislation or changes in regulations could disrupt our operations reduce our profitability or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies  labor shortages could restrict our ability to operate our properties or grow our business or result in increased labor costs that could adversely affect our results of operations our success depends in large part on our ability to attract retain train manage and engage employees our managed owned leased and joint venture hotels are staffed by approximately 152000 team members around the world if we are unable to attract retain train manage and engage skilled employees our ability to manage and staff the managed owned leased and joint venture hotels could be impaired which could reduce customer satisfaction in addition the inability of our franchisees to attract retain train manage and engage skilled employees for the franchised hotels could adversely affect the reputation of our brands staffing shortages in various parts of the world also could hinder our ability to grow and expand our businesses because payroll costs are a major component of the operating expenses at our hotels and our franchised hotels a shortage of skilled labor could also require higher wages that would increase labor costs which could adversely affect our results of operations any failure to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property could reduce the value of the hilton brands and harm our business the recognition and reputation of our brands are important to our success we have over 4700 trademark registrations in jurisdictions around the world for use in connection with our services at any given time we also have a number of pending applications to register trademarks and other intellectual property in the us and other jurisdictions however those trademark or other intellectual property registrations may not be granted or that the steps we take to use control or protect our trademarks or other intellectual property in the us and other jurisdictions may not always be adequate to prevent third parties from copying or using the trademarks or other intellectual property without authorization we may also fail to obtain and maintain trademark protection for all of our brands in all jurisdictions for example in certain jurisdictions third parties have registered or otherwise have the right to use certain trademarks that are the same as or similar to our trademarks which could prevent us from registering trademarks and opening hotels in that jurisdiction third parties may also challenge our rights to certain trademarks or oppose our trademark applications defending against any such proceedings may be costly and if unsuccessful 24could result in the loss of important intellectual property rights obtaining and maintaining trademark protection for multiple brands in multiple jurisdictions is also expensive and we may therefore elect not to apply for or to maintain certain trademarks our intellectual property is also vulnerable to unauthorized copying or use in some jurisdictions outside the us where local law or lax enforcement of law may not provide adequate protection if our trademarks or other intellectual property are improperly used the value and reputation of the hilton brands could be harmed there are times where we may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights litigation of this type could be costly force us to divert our resources lead to counterclaims or other claims against us or otherwise harm our business or reputation in addition we license certain of our trademarks to third parties for example we grant our franchisees a right to use certain of our trademarks in connection with their operation of the applicable property if a franchisee or other licensee fails to maintain the quality of the goods and services used in connection with the licensed trademarks our rights to and the value of our trademarks could potentially be harmed failure to maintain control and protect our trademarks and other intellectual property could likely adversely affect our ability to attract guests or thirdparty owners and could adversely affect our results in addition we license the right to use certain intellectual property from unaffiliated third parties such rights include the right to grant sublicenses to franchisees if we are unable to use such intellectual property our ability to generate revenue from such properties may be diminished thirdparty claims that we infringe intellectual property rights of others could subject us to damages and other costs and expenses third parties may make claims against us for infringing their patent trademark copyright or other intellectual property rights or for misappropriating their trade secrets we have been and are currently party to a number of such claims and may receive additional claims in the future any such claims even those without merit could be expensive and time consuming to defend and result in significant damages force us to stop using the intellectual property that is being challenged or to stop providing products or services that use the challenged intellectual property force us to redesign or rebrand our products or services require us to enter into royalty licensing coexistence or other agreements to obtain the right to use a third partys intellectual property divert managements attention and resources and limit the use or the scope of our intellectual property or other rights in addition we may be required to indemnify thirdparty owners of the hotels that we manage for any losses they incur as a result of any infringement claims against them all necessary royalty licensing or other agreements may not be available to us on acceptable terms any adverse results associated with thirdparty intellectual property claims could negatively affect our business exchange rate fluctuations and foreign exchange hedging arrangements could result in significant foreign currency gains and losses and affect our business results conducting business in currencies other than the us dollar subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could have a negative effect on financial results we earn revenues and incur expenses in foreign currencies as part of our operations outside of the us as a result fluctuations in currency exchange rates may significantly increase the amount of us dollars required for foreign currency expenses or significantly decrease the us dollars received from foreign currency revenues we also have exposure to currency translation risk because generally the results of our business outside of the us are reported in local currency and then translated to us dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements as a result changes between the foreign exchange rates and the us dollar will affect the recorded amounts of our foreign assets liabilities revenues and expenses and could have a negative effect on financial results our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will grow if the relative contribution of our operations outside the us increases to attempt to mitigate foreign currency exposure we may enter into foreign exchange hedging agreements with financial institutions to reduce certain of our exposures to fluctuations in currency exchange rates however these hedging agreements 25may not eliminate foreign currency risk entirely and involve costs and risks of their own in the form of transaction costs credit requirements and counterparty risk if the insurance that we or our owners carry does not sufficiently cover damage or other potential losses or liabilities to third parties involving properties that we manage franchise or own our profits could be reduced we operate in certain areas where the risk of natural disaster or other catastrophic losses vary and the occasional incidence of such an event could cause substantial damage to us our owners or the surrounding area we carry and we require our owners to carry insurance from solvent insurance carriers that we believe is adequate for foreseeable first and thirdparty losses and with terms and conditions that are reasonable and customary nevertheless market forces beyond our control could limit the scope of the insurance coverage that we and our owners can obtain or which may otherwise restrict our or our owners ability to buy insurance coverage at reasonable rates in the event of a substantial loss the insurance coverage that we andor our owners carry may not be sufficient to pay the full value of our financial obligations our liabilities or the replacement cost of any lost investment or property because certain types of losses are uncertain they can be uninsurable or prohibitively expensive in addition there are other risks that may fall outside the general coverage terms and limits of our policies  in some cases these factors could result in certain losses being completely uninsured as a result we could lose some or all of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenues profits management fees or franchise fees from the property terrorism insurance may not be available at commercially reasonable rates or at all following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks in new york city and the washington dc area congress passed the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 which established the terrorism insurance program to provide insurance capacity for terrorist acts on december 26 2007 the terrorism insurance program was extended by the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of 2007 through december 31 2014 tripra we carry and we require our owners and our franchisees to carry insurance from solvent insurance carriers to respond to both firstparty and thirdparty liability losses related to terrorism we purchase our firstparty property damage and business interruption insurance from a standalone market in place of and to supplement insurance from government run pools if tripra is not extended or renewed upon its expiration in 2014 premiums for terrorism insurance coverage will likely increase andor the terms of such insurance may be materially amended to increase stated exclusions or to otherwise effectively decrease the scope of coverage available perhaps to the point where it is effectively unavailable terrorist attacks and military conflicts may adversely affect the hospitality industry the terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon on september 11 2001 underscore the possibility that large public facilities or economically important assets could become the target of terrorist attacks in the future in particular properties that are wellknown or are located in concentrated business sectors in major cities may be subject to the risk of terrorist attacks the occurrence or the possibility of terrorist attacks or military conflicts could cause damage to one or more of our properties that may not be fully covered by insurance to the value of the damages cause all or portions of affected properties to be shut down for prolonged periods resulting in a loss of income generally reduce travel to affected areas for tourism and business or adversely affect the willingness of customers to stay in or avail themselves of the services of the affected properties expose us to a risk of monetary claims arising out of death injury or damage to property caused by any such attacks and result in higher costs for security and insurance premiums or diminish the availability of insurance coverage for losses related to terrorist attacks particularly for properties in target areas all of which could adversely affect our results certain of our buildings are also highly profitable properties to our business in addition to the effects noted above the occurrence of a terrorist attack with respect to one of these properties could directly and materially adversely affect our results 26of operations furthermore the loss of any of our wellknown buildings could indirectly affect the value of our brands which would in turn adversely affect our business prospects changes in us federal state and local or foreign tax law interpretations of existing tax law or adverse determinations by tax authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations we are subject to taxation at the federal state or provincial and local levels in the us and various other countries and jurisdictions our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates changes in statutory rates and other legislative changes changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax from time to time the us federal state and local and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their application which could result in materially higher corporate taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations we record tax expense based in part on our estimates of expected future tax rates reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions and valuation allowances related to certain net deferred tax assets including net operating loss carryforwards we are subject to ongoing and periodic tax audits and disputes in us federal and various state local and foreign jurisdictions in particular our consolidated us federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended december 31 2006 and october 24 2007 are under audit by the internal revenue service irs and the irs has proposed adjustments to increase our taxable income based on several assertions involving intercompany loans our hilton hhonors guest loyalty and reward program and our foreigncurrency denominated loans issued by one of our subsidiaries in total the proposed adjustments sought by the irs would result in us federal tax owed of approximately 696 million excluding interest and penalties and potential state income taxes we disagree with the irss position on each of the assertions and intend to vigorously contest them see note 19 income taxes in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information an unfavorable outcome from any tax audit could result in higher tax costs penalties and interest thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results of operations changes to accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations new accounting rules or regulations and varying interpretations of existing accounting rules or regulations have occurred and may occur in the future a change in accounting rules or regulations may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective and future changes to accounting rules or regulations or the questioning of current accounting practices may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations for example in 2013 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a revised exposure draft outlining proposed changes to current lease accounting in fasb accounting standards codification topic 840 leases the proposed accounting standards update if ultimately adopted in its current form could result in significant changes to current accounting including the capitalization of leases on the balance sheet that currently are recorded offbalance sheet as operating leases while this change would not affect the cash flow related to our leased hotels and other leased assets it could adversely affect our balance sheet and could therefore affect our ability to raise financing from banks or other sources changes to estimates or projections used to assess the fair value of our assets or operating results that are lower than our current estimates at certain locations may cause us to incur impairment charges that could adversely affect our results of operationsour total assets include goodwill intangible assets with indefinite lives other intangible assets with finite useful lives and substantial amounts of longlived assets principally property and equipment including hotel properties we evaluate our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis or at other times during the year if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value is below the carrying value we evaluate intangible assets with finite useful lives and longlived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable our evaluation of impairment requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions including projections of future results after performing our evaluation for impairment including an analysis to determine the recoverability of longlived assets we will record an impairment loss when the carrying value of the underlying asset asset group or reporting unit exceeds its fair value if the estimates or assumptions used in our evaluation of impairment change we may be required to record additional impairment losses on certain of these assets if these impairment losses are significant our results of operations would be adversely affected 27governmental regulation may adversely affect the operation of our properties in many jurisdictions the hotel industry is subject to extensive foreign or us federal state and local governmental regulations including those relating to the service of alcoholic beverages the preparation and sale of food and those relating to building and zoning requirements we are also subject to licensing and regulation by foreign or us state and local departments relating to health sanitation fire and safety standards and to laws governing their relationships with employees including minimum wage requirements overtime working conditions and citizenship requirements we or our thirdparty owners may be required to expend funds to meet foreign or us federal state and local regulations in connection with the continued operation or remodeling of certain of our properties the failure to meet the requirements of applicable regulations and licensing requirements or publicity resulting from actual or alleged failures could have an adverse effect on our results of operations foreign or us environmental laws and regulations may cause us to incur substantial costs or subject us to potential liabilities we are subject to certain compliance costs and potential liabilities under various foreign and us federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations govern actions including air emissions the use storage and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances and wastewater disposal our failure to comply with such laws including any required permits or licenses could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct some of our operations we could also be liable under such laws for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at our currently or formerly owned leased or operated real property including managed and franchised properties or at thirdparty locations in connection with our waste disposal operations regardless of whether or not we knew of or caused the presence or release of such substances from time to time we may be required to remediate such substances or remove abate or manage asbestos mold radon gas lead or other hazardous conditions at our properties the presence or release of such toxic or hazardous substances could result in thirdparty claims for personal injury property or natural resource damages business interruption or other losses such claims and the need to investigate remediate or otherwise address hazardous toxic or unsafe conditions could adversely affect our operations the value of any affected real property or our ability to sell lease or assign our rights in any such property or could otherwise harm our business or reputation environmental health and safety requirements have also become increasingly stringent and our costs may increase as a result for example the us congress the us environmental protection agency and some states are considering or have undertaken actions to regulate and reduce greenhouse gas emissions new or revised laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations such as those related to climate change could affect the operation of our properties or result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on us the potential for changes in the frequency duration and severity of extreme weather events that may be a result of climate change could lead to significant property damage at our hotels and other assets affect our ability to obtain insurance coverage in areas that are most vulnerable to such events such as the coastal resort areas where we operate and have a negative effect on revenues the cost of compliance with the americans with disabilities act and similar legislation outside of the us may be substantial we are subject to the americans with disabilities act ada and similar legislation in certain jurisdictions outside of the us under the ada all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons these regulations apply to accommodations first occupied after january 26 1993 public accommodations built before january 26 1993 are required to remove architectural barriers to disabled access where such removal is readily achievable the regulations also mandate certain operational requirements that hotel operators must observe the failure of a property to comply with the ada could result in injunctive relief fines an award of damages to private litigants or mandated capital expenditures to remedy such noncompliance any imposition of injunctive relief fines damage awards or capital expenditures could adversely affect the ability of an owner or franchisee to make payments under the applicable management or franchise agreement or negatively affect the reputation of our brands in november 2010 we entered into a settlement with the us department of justice related to compliance with the ada under the terms of the settlement until november 2014 we must ensure compliance with ada regulations at our owned and joint venture in which we own more than a 50 interest properties built after january 26 1993 require managed or franchised hotels built after january 26 1993 that enter into a new management or franchise agreement experience a change in ownership or renew or extend a management or franchise agreement to conduct a survey of its facilities and to certify that the hotel complies with the ada ensure that new hotels constructed in our system are compliant with ada regulations provide ada training to our team members improve the accessibility of our websites and reservations system for individuals with disabilities appoint a national ada compliance officer and appoint an ada contact onsite at each hotel if we fail to comply with the requirements of the ada and our related consent decree we could be subject to fines penalties injunctive action reputational harm and other business effects which could materially and negatively affect our performance and results of operations 28casinos featured on certain of our properties are subject to gaming laws and noncompliance could result in the revocation of the gaming licenses several of our properties feature casinos most of which are operated by third parties factors affecting the economic performance of a casino property include location including proximity to or easy access from major population centers appearance local regional or national economic conditions which may limit the amount of disposable income that potential patrons may have for gambling the existence or construction of competing casinos dependence on tourism and governmental regulation jurisdictions in which our properties containing casinos are located including nevada new jersey puerto rico and egypt have laws and regulations governing the conduct of casino gaming these jurisdictions generally require that the operator of a casino must be found suitable and be registered once issued a registration remains in force until revoked the law defines the grounds for registration as well as revocation or suspension of such registration the loss of a gaming license for any reason would have a material adverse effect on the value of a casino property and could reduce fee income associated with such operations and consequently negatively affect our business results we are subject to risks from litigation filed by or against us legal or governmental proceedings brought by or on behalf of franchisees thirdparty owners of managed properties employees or customers may adversely affect our financial results in recent years a number of hospitality companies have been subject to lawsuits including class action lawsuits alleging violations of federal laws and regulations regarding workplace and employment matters consumer protection claims and other commercial matters a number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants similar lawsuits have been and may be instituted against us from time to time and we may incur substantial damages and expenses resulting from lawsuits of this type which could have a material adverse effect on our business at any given time we may be engaged in lawsuits involving thirdparty owners of our hotels similarly we may from time to time institute legal proceedings on behalf of ourselves or others the ultimate outcome of which could cause us to incur substantial damages and expenses which could have a material adverse effect on our business  risks relating to our indebtedness our substantial indebtedness and other contractual obligations could adversely affect our financial condition our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations our ability to operate our business our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and our ability to pay our debts and could divert our cash flow from operations for debt payments we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of december 31 2013 our total indebtedness was approximately 127 billion including 968 million of nonrecourse debt and our contractual debt maturities of our longterm debt and nonrecourse debt for the years ending december 31 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively were 52 million 69 million and 622 million our substantial debt and other contractual obligations could have important consequences including requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations capital expenditures and pursue future business opportunitiesincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic industry or competitive developments exposing us to increased interest expense as our degree of leverage may cause the interest rates of any future indebtedness whether fixed or floating rate interest to be higher than they would be otherwise 29exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our indebtedness is at variable rates of interest making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments including restrictive covenants could result in an event of default that accelerates our obligation to repay indebtedness restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make nonstrategic divestitures limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures product development satisfaction of debt service requirements acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes and limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may be better positioned to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting we are a holding company and substantially all of our consolidated assets are owned by and most of our business is conducted through our subsidiaries revenues from these subsidiaries are our primary source of funds for debt payments and operating expenses if our subsidiaries are restricted from making distributions to us that may impair our ability to meet our debt service obligations or otherwise fund our operations moreover there may be restrictions on payments by subsidiaries to their parent companies under applicable laws including laws that require companies to maintain minimum amounts of capital and to make payments to stockholders only from profits as a result although a subsidiary of ours may have cash we may not be able to obtain that cash to satisfy our obligation to service our outstanding debt or fund our operations  certain of our debt agreements impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities the indenture that governs our senior notes the credit agreement that governs our senior secured credit facilities and the agreements that govern our commercial mortgagebacked securities loan and the mortgage loan secured by our waldorf astoria new york property impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us these restrictions limit our ability andor the ability of our subsidiaries to among other things incur or guarantee additional debt or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock pay dividends including to us and make other distributions on or redeem or repurchase capital stock make certain investments incur certain liens enter into transactions with affiliates merge or consolidate enter into agreements that restrict the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make dividends or other payments to the issuers designate restricted subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries and transfer or sell assets in addition if on the last day of any period of four consecutive quarters on or after june 30 2014 the aggregate principal amount of revolving credit loans swing line loans andor letters of credit excluding up to 50 million of letters of credit and certain other letters of credit that have been cash collateralized or backstopped that are issued andor outstanding is greater than 25 of the revolving credit facility the credit agreement will require us to maintain a consolidated first lien net leverage ratio not to exceed 79 to 10 our subsidiaries mortgagebacked loans also require them to maintain certain debt service coverage ratios and minimum net worth requirements 30as a result of these restrictions we are limited as to how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities the terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants we may not be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and if we fail to do so we may not be able to obtain waivers from the lenders andor amend the covenants our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above as well as other terms of our other indebtedness andor the terms of any future indebtedness from time to time could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their due date if we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or are unable to refinance these borrowings our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected servicing our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors some of which are not within our control our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future to a certain extent this is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt and meet our other commitments we may need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt sell material assets or operations or raise additional debt or equity capital we may not be able to effect any of these actions on a timely basis on commercially reasonable terms or at all and these actions may not be sufficient to meet our capital requirements in addition the terms of our existing or future debt arrangements may restrict us from effecting any of these alternatives  despite our current level of indebtedness we may be able to incur substantially more debt and enter into other transactions which could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above we may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future although the credit agreements and indentures that govern substantially all of our indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and entering into certain types of other transactions these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial these restrictions also do not prevent us from incurring obligations such as trade payables that do not constitute indebtedness as defined under our debt instruments to the extent new debt is added to our current debt levels the substantial leverage risks described in the preceding two risk factors would increase risks related to ownership of our common stock our sponsor and its affiliates control us and their interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future our sponsor and its affiliates beneficially owned approximately 764 of our common stock as of february 12 2014 moreover under our bylaws and the stockholders agreement with our sponsor and its affiliates for so long as our existing owners and their affiliates retain significant ownership of us we have agreed to nominate to our board individuals designated by our sponsor whom we refer to as the sponsor directors even when our sponsor and its affiliates cease to own shares of our stock representing a majority of the total voting power for so long as our sponsor continues to own a significant percentage of our stock our sponsor will still be able to significantly influence the composition of our board of directors and the approval of actions requiring stockholder approval accordingly for such period of time our sponsor will have significant influence with respect to our management business plans and policies including the appointment and removal of our officers in particular for so long as our sponsor continues to own a significant percentage of our stock our sponsor will be able to cause or prevent a change of control of our company or a change in the composition of our board of directors and could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of our company the concentration of ownership could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of common stock as part of a sale of our company and ultimately might affect the market price of our common stock our sponsor and its affiliates engage in a broad spectrum of activities including investments in real estate generally and in the hospitality industry in particular in the ordinary course of their business activities our sponsor and its affiliates may engage in activities where their interests conflict with our interests or those of our stockholders for example our sponsor owns interests in extended stay america inc and la quinta hotels and certain other investments in the hotel industry that compete directly or indirectly with us in addition affiliates of our sponsor directly and indirectly own hotels that we manage or franchise and they may in the future enter into other transactions with us including hotel or timeshare development projects 31that could result in their having interests that could conflict with ours our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that none of our sponsor any of its affiliates or any director who is not employed by us including any nonemployee director who serves as one of our officers in both his director and officer capacities or his or her affiliates will have any duty to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate our sponsor also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us in addition blackstone may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions divestitures and other transactions that in its judgment could enhance its investment even though such transactions might involve risks to you  we are a controlled company within the meaning of new york stock exchange nyse rules and as a result qualify for and rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements affiliates of our sponsor control a majority of the combined voting power of all classes of our stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors as a result we are a controlled company within the meaning of nyse corporate governance standards under these rules a controlled company may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance standards such as requirements that within one year of the date of nyse listing a company have a board that is composed of a majority of independent directors as defined under nyse rules a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors and a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors we do not have a majority of independent directors on our board in addition although we have a fully independent audit committee and have independent director representation on our compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees our compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees do not consist entirely of independent directors we intend to continue to utilize these controlled company exemptions accordingly our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the nyse corporate governance requirements we will incur increased costs and become subject to additional regulations and requirements as a public company which could lower our profits or make it more difficult to run our business as a public company we will incur significant legal accounting and other expenses including costs associated with public company reporting requirements we also have incurred and will incur costs associated with the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the sarbanesoxley act and related rules implemented by the sec and the nyse the expenses incurred by public companies generally for reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing we expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more timeconsuming and costly although we are currently unable to estimate these costs with any degree of certainty these laws and regulations also could make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance including director and officer liability insurance and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage these laws and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors our board committees or as our executive officers furthermore if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company we could be subject to delisting of our common stock fines sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation if we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock may be negatively affected as a public company we are required to maintain internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls in addition beginning with our second annual report on form 10k we will be required to furnish reports by management and our independent registered public accountants on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act the process of designing implementing and testing the internal control over financial reporting required to comply with this obligation is time consuming costly and complicated if we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting if we are unable to comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act in a timely manner or to assert that our internal control over 32financial reporting is effective or if our

the approval of 80 percent or more of all the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote andthese provisions establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings further as a delaware corporation we are also subject to provisions of delaware law which may impair a takeover attempt that our stockholders may find beneficial these antitakeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law could discourage delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company including actions that our stockholders may deem advantageous or negatively affect the trading price of our common stock these provisions could also discourage proxy contests

december 31 2013 approximately 77 percent of our systemwide hotel rooms were located in the us we expect that the percentage of our hotel rooms outside the us will continue to increase in future years as hotels in our pipeline open system growth and pipelineto support our growth strategy we continue to expand our development pipeline as of december 31 2013 we had a total of 1123 hotels in our

of the rooms under construction and in our total pipeline were within our management and franchise segment and only one development project was within our ownership segment we do not consider that project or any individual development project relating to properties under our management and franchise segment to be material to us 44our management and franchise contracts are designed to expand our business with limited or no capital investment the capital required to build and maintain hotels that we manage or franchise is typically provided by the owner of the respective hotel with minimal or no capital required by us as the manager or franchisor additionally prior to approving the addition of new hotels to our management and franchise development pipeline we evaluate the economic viability of the hotel based on the geographic location the credit quality of the thirdparty owner and other factors as a result by increasing the number of management and franchise agreements with thirdparty owners we expect to achieve a higher overall return on invested capitalrecent eventsinitial public offeringon december 17 2013 we completed our ipo in which we sold 64102564 shares of

indebtedness in connection with the debt refinancingfor more information on these transactions see liquidity and capital resources as well as note 13 debt and note 14 deferred revenues in our consolidated financial statements principal components and factors affecting our results of operationsrevenuesprincipal componentswe primarily derive our revenues from the following sourcesowned and leased hotels represents revenues derived from hotel operations including room rentals food and beverage sales and other ancillary services these revenues are primarily derived from two categories of customers transient and group transient guests are individual travelers who are traveling for business or leisure our group guests are traveling for group events that reserve rooms for meetings conferences or social functions sponsored by associations corporate social military educational religious or other organizations group business usually includes a block of room accommodations as well as other ancillary services such as catering and banquet services a majority 45of our food and beverage sales and other ancillary services are provided to customers who are also occupying rooms at our hotel properties as a result occupancy affects all components of our owned and leased hotel revenuesmanagement and franchise fees and other represents revenues derived from management fees earned from hotels and timeshare properties managed by us franchise fees received in connection with the franchising of our brands and other revenue generated by the incidental support of hotel operations for owned leased managed and franchised properties and other rental incometerms of our management agreements vary but our fees generally consist of a base fee which is typically a percentage of each hotels gross revenue and in some cases an incentive fee which is based on gross operating profits cash flow or a combination thereof management fees from timeshare properties are generally a fixed amount as stated in the management agreement outside of the us our fees are often more dependent on hotel profitability measures either through a single management fee structure where the entire fee is based on a profitability measure or because our twotier fee structure is more heavily weighted toward the incentive fee than the base fee additionally we receive onetime upfront fees upon execution of certain management contracts in general the hotel owner pays all operating and other expenses and reimburses our outofpocket expenses the initial terms of our management agreements for fullservice hotels typically are 20 years extensions are negotiated and vary but typically are more prevalent in fullservice hotels typically these agreements contain one or two extension options that are either for 5 or 10 years and can be exercised at our or the other partys option or by mutual agreement some of our management agreements provide early termination rights to hotel owners upon certain events including the failure to meet certain financial or performance criteria performance test measures typically are based upon the hotels performance individually or in comparison to specified hotels under our franchise agreements franchisees pay us franchise fees which consist of initial application and initiation fees for new hotels entering the system and monthly royalty fees generally calculated as a percentage of room revenues royalty fees for our fullservice brands may also include a percentage of gross food and beverage revenues and other revenues where applicable in addition to the franchise application and royalty fees franchisees also generally pay a monthly program fee based on a percentage of the total gross room revenue that covers the cost of advertising and marketing programs internet technology and reservation system expenses and quality assurance program costs our franchise agreements typically have initial terms of approximately 20 years for new construction and approximately 10 to 20 years for properties that are converted from other brands at the expiration of the initial term we may relicense the hotel to the franchisee at our option the hotel owners option or by mutual agreement for an additional term ranging from 10 to 15 years we have the right to terminate a franchise agreement upon specified events of default including nonpayment of fees or noncompliance with brand standards if a franchise agreement is terminated by us because of a franchisees default the franchisee is contractually required to pay us liquidated damagestimeshare represents revenues derived from the sale and financing of timeshare units and revenues from enrollments and other fees rentals of timeshare units food and beverage sales and other ancillary services at our timeshare properties and fees which we refer to as resort operations additionally in recent years we began a transformation of our timeshare business to a capital light model in which thirdparty timeshare owners and developers provide capital for development while we act as the sales and marketing agent and property manager through these transactions we receive a sales and marketing commission and branding fees on sales of timeshare intervals recurring fees to operate the homeowners associations and revenues from resort operations other revenues from managed and franchised properties these revenues represent the payroll and its related costs for properties that we manage where the property employees are legally our responsibility as well as certain other operating costs of the managed and franchised properties operations marketing expenses and other expenses associated with our brands and shared services that are contractually either reimbursed to us by the property owners or paid from fees collected in advance from these properties the corresponding expenses are presented as other expenses from managed and franchised properties in our consolidated statements of operations resulting in no effect on operating income or net income46factors affecting our revenuesthe following factors affect the revenues we derive from our operationsconsumer demand and global economic conditions consumer demand for our products and services is closely linked to the performance of the general economy and is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels declines in consumer demand due to adverse general economic conditions risks affecting or reducing travel patterns lower consumer confidence and adverse political conditions can lower the revenues and profitability of our owned and leased operations and the amount of management and franchise fee revenues we are able to generate from our managed and franchised properties further competition for hotel guests and the supply of hotel services affect our ability to increase rates charged to customers at our hotels also declines in hotel profitability during an economic downturn directly affect the incentive portion of our management fees which is based on hotel profit measures our timeshare segment also is linked to cycles in the general economy and consumer discretionary spending as a result changes in consumer demand and general business cycles can subject and have subjected our revenues to significant volatilityour results of operations have steadily improved as the global economy continues to recover resulting in an increase in systemwide revpar of 88 percent from the year ended december 31 2011 to the year ended december 31 2013agreements with thirdparty owners and franchisees and relationships with developers we depend on our longterm management and franchise agreements with thirdparty owners and franchisees for a significant portion of our management and franchise fee revenues the success and sustainability of our management and franchise business depends on our ability to perform under our management and franchise agreements and maintain good relationships with thirdparty owners and franchisees our relationships with these third parties also generate new relationships with developers and opportunities for property development that can support our growth growth and maintenance of our hotel system and earning fees relating to hotels in the pipeline are dependent on the ability of developers and owners to access capital for the development maintenance and renovation of properties we believe that we have good relationships with our thirdparty owners franchisees and developers and are committed to the continued growth and development of these relationships these relationships exist with a diverse group of owners franchisees and developers and are not significantly concentrated with any particular third party additionally in recent years we have entered into sales and marketing agreements to sell timeshare units on behalf of thirdparty developers our supply of thirdparty developed timeshare intervals was approximately 73000 or 78 percent of total supply as of december 31 2013 we expect sales and marketing agreements with thirdparty developers and resort operations to comprise a growing percentage of our timeshare revenue and revenues derived from the sale and financing of timeshare units developed by us to comprise a smaller percentage of our timeshare revenue in future periods consistent with our strategy to focus our business on the management aspects and deploy less of our capital to asset construction expensesprincipal componentswe primarily incur the following expensesowned and leased hotels owned and leased hotel expenses reflect the operating expenses of our consolidated owned and leased hotels including room expense food and beverage costs other support costs and property expenses room expense includes compensation costs for housekeeping laundry and front desk staff and supply costs for guest room amenities and laundry food and beverage costs include costs for wait and kitchen staff and food and beverage products other support expenses consist of costs associated with propertylevel management utilities sales and marketing operating hotel spas telephones parking and other guest recreation entertainment and services property expenses include property taxes repairs and maintenance rent and insurancetimeshare timeshare expenses include the cost of inventory sold during the period sales and marketing expenses resort operations expenses and other overhead expenses associated with our timeshare businessdepreciation and amortization these are noncash expenses that primarily consist of depreciation of fixed assets such as buildings furniture fixtures and equipment at our consolidated owned and leased hotels as well as certain corporate assets amortization expense primarily consists of amortization of our management and franchise intangibles which are amortized over their estimated useful lives additionally we amortize capitalized software over the estimated useful life of the software47general administrative and other expenses general administrative and other expenses consist primarily of compensation expense for our corporate staff and personnel supporting our business segments including divisional offices that support our management and franchise segment professional fees including consulting audit and legal fees travel and entertainment expenses bad debt expenses contractual performance obligations and office administrative and related expenses expenses incurred by our supply management business laundry facilities and other ancillary businesses are also included in general administrative and other expenses impairment losses we hold significant amounts of goodwill amortizing and nonamortizing intangible assets longlived assets and investments we evaluate these assets for impairment as further discussed in critical accounting policies and estimates these evaluations have in the past resulted in impairment losses for certain of these assets based on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding the assets and our estimates of fair value based on economic conditions or other factors at a propertyspecific or companywide level we may be required to take additional impairment losses to reflect further declines in our asset andor investment valuesother expenses from managed and franchised properties these expenses represent the payroll and its related costs for properties that we manage where the property employees are legally our responsibility as well as certain other operating costs of the managed and franchised properties operations marketing expenses and other expenses associated with our brands and shared services that are contractually either reimbursed to us by the property owners or paid from fees collected in advance from these properties the corresponding revenues are presented as other revenues from managed and franchised properties in our consolidated statements of operations resulting in no effect on operating income or net incomefactors affecting our costs and expensesthe following are principal factors that affect the costs and expenses we incur in the course of our operations fixed expenses many of the expenses associated with managing franchising and owning hotels and timeshare resorts are relatively fixed these expenses include personnel costs rent property taxes insurance and utilities as well as sales and marketing expenses for our timeshare segment if we are unable to decrease these costs significantly or rapidly when demand for our hotels and other properties decreases the resulting decline in our revenues can have an adverse effect on our net cash flow margins and profits this effect can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth economic downturns generally affect the results of our owned and leased hotel segment more significantly than the results of our management and franchising segments due to the high fixed costs associated with operating an owned or leased hotel the effectiveness of any costcutting efforts is limited by the fixed costs inherent in our business as a result we may not be able to offset revenue reductions through cost cutting employees at some of our owned and leased hotels are parties to collective bargaining agreements that may also limit our ability to make timely staffing or labor changes in response to declining revenues in addition any efforts to reduce costs or to defer or cancel capital improvements could adversely affect the economic value of our hotels and brands we have taken steps to reduce our fixed costs to levels we feel are appropriate to maximize profitability and respond to market conditions without jeopardizing the overall customer experience or the value of our hotels or brands also a significant portion of our costs to support our timeshare business relates to direct sales and marketing of these units in periods of decreased demand for timeshare units we may be unable to reduce our sales and marketing expenses quickly enough to prevent a deterioration of our profit margins on our timeshare businesschanges in depreciation and amortization expense changes in depreciation expense may be driven by renovations of existing hotels acquisition or development of new hotels the disposition of existing hotels through sale or closure or changes in estimates of the useful lives of our assets as we place new assets into service we will be required to record additional depreciation expense on those assets additionally we capitalize costs associated with certain software development projects and as those projects are completed and placed into service amortization expense will increase48other itemseffect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuationssignificant portions of our operations are conducted in functional currencies other than our reporting currency which is the us dollar usd and we have assets and liabilities denominated in a variety of foreign currencies as a result we are required to translate those results assets and liabilities from the functional currency into usd at market based exchange rates for each reporting period when comparing our results of operations between periods there may be material portions of the changes in our revenues or expenses that are derived from fluctuations in exchange rates experienced between those periodsseasonalitythe lodging industry is seasonal in nature however the periods during which our hotels experience higher or lower levels of demand vary from property to property and depend upon location type of property and competitive mix within the specific location based on historical results we generally expect our revenue to be lower during the first calendar quarter of each year than during each of the three subsequent quarters with the fourth quarter producing the strongest revenues of the yearkey business and financial metrics used by managementcomparable hotelswe define our comparable hotels as those that i were active and operating in our system for at least one full calendar year as of the end of the current period and open january 1st of the previous year ii have not undergone a change in brand or ownership during the current or comparable periods reported and iii have not sustained substantial property damage business interruption undergone or planned to undergo largescale capital projects or for which comparable results are not available of the 4073 hotels in our system as of december 31 2013 3548 have been classified as comparable hotels our 525 noncomparable hotels include 14 properties or less than one percent of the total hotels in our system that have been removed from the comparable group during the last year because they have sustained substantial property damage business interruption undergone largescale capital projects or comparable results were not available of the 3926 hotels in our system as of december 31 2012 3484 have been classified as comparable hotels for the year ended december 31 2012 occupancyoccupancy represents the total number of rooms sold divided by the total number of rooms available at a hotel or group of hotels occupancy measures the utilization of our hotels available capacity management uses occupancy to gauge demand at a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period occupancy levels also help us determine achievable adr levels as demand for hotel rooms increases or decreasesaverage daily rateadr represents hotel room revenue divided by total number of rooms sold in a given period adr measures average room price attained by a hotel and adr trends provide useful information concerning the pricing environment and the nature of the customer base of a hotel or group of hotels adr is a commonly used performance measure in the industry and we use adr to assess pricing levels that we are able to generate by type of customer as changes in rates have a different effect on overall revenues and incremental profitability than changes in occupancy as described aboverevenue per available roomwe calculate revpar by dividing hotel room revenue by room nights available to guests for the period we consider revpar to be a meaningful indicator of our performance as it provides a metric correlated to two primary and key drivers of operations at our hotels occupancy and adr revpar is also a useful indicator in measuring performance over comparable periods for comparable hotels references to revpar and adr throughout this report

totaled 2058 million and 1922 million respectively the increase of 136 million or 71 percent was primarily driven by an increase in revpar at our us comparable owned and leased hotels of 68 percent which was due to increases in occupancy and adr of 16 percentage points and 45 percent respectively as of december 31 2013 we had 89 consolidated owned and leased hotels located outside of the us

revenue was a result of a 44 million decrease in revenue from hotels that we sold or where leases expired during the periods offset by an increase in revenues from our international comparable owned

increases in revpar of 60 percent and 50 percent at our comparable managed and franchised properties respectively the increases in revpar for managed and franchised hotels were driven by both increases in occupancy and adr the addition of new hotels to our managed and franchised system also contributed to the growth in revenue during 2013 we added 45 managed properties on a net basis contributing an additional 10196 rooms to our system as well as 108 franchised properties on a net basis providing an additional 16084 rooms to our system as new hotels are established in our system we expect the fees received from such hotels to increase as they are part of our system for full periodsother revenues for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 were 60 million and 56 million respectively the increase was primarily driven by an increase in revenues received from our supply management businesstimeshare timeshare revenue increased 24 million due to an increase of approximately 63 million in sales commissions generated from projects developed by third parties as a result of three properties comprising 1049 units commencing sales during or after the year ended december 31 2012 additionally there was an increase of approximately 9 million in revenue from our resort operations primarily due to increases in club fees and room rentals as well as an increase of approximately 9 million in financing and other revenues primarily due to increases in portfolio interest income these increases were offset by a decrease of approximately 57 million in revenue from the sale of timeshare units developed by us due to lower sales volume of our owned timeshare inventory which we expect to continue as we further develop our capital light timeshare business with a focus on selling timeshare intervals on behalf of thirdparty developers operating expenses year ended december 31 percent change 2013 2012 2013 vs 2012 in millions  owned and leased hotels3147 3230

in 2012 as well as cost mitigation strategies and operational efficiencies employed at all of our owned and leased properties52timesharetimeshare expense decreased 28 million primarily due to lower

2011 totaled 1922 million and 1822 million respectively the increase of 100 million or 55 percent was primarily driven by an increase in revpar of 51 percent which was due to increases in adr and occupancy at our us comparable owned and leased hotels of 15 percent and 27 percentage points respectively these increases were primarily driven by business from transient guests as room revenue from transient guests at our us comparable owned and leased hotels increased 104 percent due to increases in transient adr of 29 percent and transient occupancy of 73 percent the increased transient room revenue was in part offset by decreases in room revenue from group travel at our us comparable owned and leased hotels of 30 percent during the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the year ended december 31 2011 the decrease in group room revenue at our us comparable owned and leased hotels was primarily due to one large group at one hotel driving significant group room revenue in 2011 that

neutral basis international owned and leased hotel revenue increased 57 million or 29 percent the increase was primarily driven by an increase in revpar of 34 percent which was due to an increase in occupancy at our comparable international owned and leased hotels of 19 percentage points while adr remained relatively consistent period over period the increase was also due to recovery in japan as operations stabilized in the third quarter of 2011 after the natural disasters negatively affected revenues for the first half of 2011 this recovery resulted in an increase in revpar at our comparable japanese owned and leased hotels of 182 percent which was driven by an increase in occupancy and adr of 105 percentage points and 21 percent respectivelymanagement and franchise fees and

franchise business reflects increases in revpar of 49 percent and 62 percent at our comparable managed and franchised properties respectively the increases in revpar for both comparable periods for managed and franchised hotels were primarily driven by increased occupancy and rates charged to gueststhe addition of new hotels to our managed and franchised system also contributed to the growth in

decreased 33 million primarily due to capital lease amendments which resulted in extending asset useful lives in the second half of 2011 as well as 2011 impairments which resulted in lower depreciable asset bases for 2012 these instances led to lower depreciation expense on the same assets for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the year ended december 31 2011 amortization expense increased

renovations at certain of our owned and leased properties in 2012 and a decrease in software capitalization costs of 25 million as a result of corporate software projects that were completed in 2012 additionally there was an increase in distributions from unconsolidated affiliates of 25 million primarily related to the sales of our interests in two joint venture entities the decrease in net cash used in investing activities was partially offset by an increase in acquisitions of 30 million primarily due to the acquisition of a parcel of land that we previously held under a longterm ground lease for 28 million the 95 million increase in net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the year ended december 31 2011 was primarily attributable to an increase in capital expenditures for property and equipment of 44 million a decrease in proceeds from asset dispositions of 65 million and a decrease in distributions from unconsolidated affiliates of 15 million the majority of the increase in capital expenditures related to improvements at existing hotel properties the decrease in proceeds from asset dispositions was a result of proceeds of 65 million from the sale of our former corporate headquarters office building in 2011 while the decrease in distributions from unconsolidated affiliates resulted from 64the sale of our interest in a joint venture entity of 8 million in 2012 compared to proceeds from the sale of our interest in a hotel development joint venture of 23 million in 2011 for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and

cash used in financing activities during the year ended december 31 2013 was 1863 million compared to 576 million during the year ended december 31 2012 the 1287 million increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to a 2357 million increase in net repayments of debt primarily related to an increase in unscheduled voluntary debt repayments on our secured debt the repayment of the secured debt in connection with the debt refinancing and unscheduled voluntary repayments of 350 million on our term loans subsequent to the debt refinancing the increase in net debt repayments was offset by 1243 million in proceeds from our ipo which was used to repay amounts outstanding on our term loans additionally we paid 180 million of debt issuance costs related to the debt refinancing net cash used in financing activities during the year ended december 31 2012 decreased 138 million compared to the year ended december 31 2011 due to a change in restricted cash and cash equivalents that increased cash available for financing activities by 212 million as well as an increase in borrowings of 56 million primarily related to our consolidated vies the change in restricted cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to a decrease of 174 million in our prefunded cash reserves which was a result of using the reserves for capital expenditures the increases in cash provided by financing activities were partially offset by an increase in our debt repayments of 128 million which primarily related to an increase in nonrecourse debt repayments related to our consolidated vies of 90 millioncapital expendituresour capital expenditures for property and equipment of 254 million 433 million and 389 million made during the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011

with possible cash outlays totaling approximately 150 million of which we have accrued 60 million as of december 31 2013 for estimated probable exposure and construction contract commitments of approximately 121 million for capital expenditures at our owned leased and consolidated vie hotels additionally during 2010 in conjunction with a lawsuit settlement an affiliate of our sponsor entered into service contracts with the plaintiff as part of the settlement we entered into a guarantee with the plaintiff to pay any shortfall that this affiliate does not fund related to those service contracts the remaining potential exposure under this guarantee as of december 31 2013 was approximately 48 million see note 25 commitments and contingencies in our consolidated financial statements for further discussion on these amountscritical accounting policies and estimatesthe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements the 66reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods and the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 2 basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies in our consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies are critical because they involve a higher degree of judgment and the estimates required to be made were based on assumptions that are inherently uncertain as a result these accounting policies could materially affect our financial position results of operations and related disclosures on an ongoing basis we evaluate these estimates and judgments based on historical experiences and various other factors that are believed to reflect the current circumstances while we believe our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based on information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates due to changes in judgments assumptions and conditions as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise which could have a material effect on our financial position or results of operationsmanagement has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directorsproperty and equipment and intangible assets with finite liveswe evaluate the carrying value of our property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives by comparing the expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the assets if we determine there are indicators of potential impairment if it is determined that the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the net book value of the assets the excess of the net book value over the estimated fair value is recorded in our consolidated statements of operations as impairment lossesas part of the process described above we exercise judgment todetermine if there are indicators of impairment present factors we consider when making this determination include assessing the overall effect of trends in the hospitality industry and the general economy historical experience capital costs and other assetspecific informationdetermine the projected undiscounted future cash flows when indicators of impairment are present judgment is required when developing projections of future revenues and expenses based on estimated growth rates over the expected useful life of the asset group these estimated growth rates are based on historical operating results as well as various internal projections and external sources anddetermine the asset fair value when required in determining the fair value we often use internallydeveloped discounted cash flow models assumptions used in the discounted cash flow models include estimating cash flows which may require us to adjust for specific market conditions as well as capitalization rates which are based on location property or asset type marketspecific dynamics and overall economic performance the discount rate takes into account our weighted average cost of capital according to our capital structure and other market specific considerationswe had 9058 million of property and equipment net and 2203 million of intangible assets with finite lives as of december 31 2013 changes in estimates and assumptions used in our impairment testing of property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives could result in future impairment losses which could be materialin conjunction with our regular assessment of impairment we did not identify any property and equipment with indicators of impairment for which a 10 percent reduction in our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows would result in impairment losses we did not identify any intangible assets with finite lives for which a 10 percent reduction in our estimates of undiscounted future cash flows projected operating results or other significant assumptions would result in impairment losses67investments in affiliateswe evaluate our investments in affiliates for impairment when there are indicators that the fair value of our investment may be less than our carrying value we record an impairment loss when we determine there has been an otherthantemporary decline in the investments fair value if an identified event or change in circumstances requires an evaluation to determine if the value of an investment may have an otherthantemporary decline we assess the fair value of the investment based on the accepted valuation methods which include discounted cash flows estimates of sales proceeds and external appraisals if an investments fair value is below its carrying value and the decline is considered to be otherthantemporary we will recognize an impairment loss in equity in earnings losses from unconsolidated affiliates for equity method investments or impairment losses for cost method investments in our consolidated statements of operationsour investments in affiliates consist primarily of our interests in entities that own andor operate hotels as such the factors we consider when determining if there are indicators of potential impairment are similar to property and equipment discussed above if there are indicators of potential impairment we estimate the fair value of our equity method and cost method investments by internally developed discounted cash flow models the principal factors used in our discounted cash flow models that require judgment are the same as the items discussed in property and equipment abovewe had 260 million of investments in affiliates as of december 31 2013 changes in the estimates and assumptions used in our investments in affiliates impairment testing can result in additional impairment expense which can materially change our consolidated financial statementsin conjunction with our regular assessment of impairment we did not identify any investments in affiliates with indicators of impairment for which a 10 percent change in our estimates of future cash flows or other significant assumptions would result in material impairment lossesgoodwillwe review the carrying value of our goodwill by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair value our reporting units are the same as our operating segments as described in note 24 business segments in our consolidated financial statements we perform this evaluation annually or at an interim date if indicators of impairment exist in any given year we may elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value if we cannot determine qualitatively that the fair value is in excess of the carrying value or we decide to bypass the qualitative assessment we proceed to the twostep quantitative process in the first step we evaluate the fair value of our reporting units quantitatively when determining fair value we utilize discounted future cash flow models as well as market conditions relative to the operations of our reporting units under the discounted cash flow approach we utilize various assumptions that require judgment including projections of revenues and expenses based on estimated longterm growth rates and discount rates based on weighted average cost of capital our estimates of longterm growth and costs are based on historical data as well as various internal projections and external sources the weighted average cost of capital is estimated based on each reporting units cost of debt and equity and a selected capital structure the selected capital structure for each reporting unit is based on consideration of capital structures of comparable publicly traded companies operating in the business of that reporting unit if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value then the second step must be performed in the second step we estimate the implied fair value of goodwill which is determined by taking the fair value of the reporting unit and allocating it to all of its assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combinationwe had 6220 million of goodwill as of december 31 2013 changes in the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment testing could result in future impairment losses which could be material a change in our estimates and assumptions that would reduce the fair value of each reporting units by 10 percent would not result in an impairment of any of our reporting units68brandswe evaluate our brand intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or at other times during the year if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the brand is below the carrying value when determining fair value we utilize discounted future cash flow models for hotels that we manage or franchise under the discounted cash flow approach we utilize various assumptions that require judgment including projections of revenues and expenses based on estimated longterm growth rates and discount rates based on weighted average cost of capital our estimates of longterm growth and costs are based on historical data as well as various internal estimates if a brands estimated current fair value is less than its respective carrying value the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recorded in our consolidated statements of operations within impairment losseswe had 5013 million of brand intangible assets as of december 31 2013 changes in the estimates and assumptions used in our brands impairment testing most notably revenue growth rates and discount rates could result in future impairment losses which could be material a change in our estimates and assumptions that would reduce the fair value of each of our brands by 10 percent would not result in an impairment of any of the brand intangible assetshilton hhonorshilton hhonors defers revenue received from participating hotels and program partners in an amount equal to the estimated cost per point of the future redemption obligation we engage outside actuaries to assist in determining the fair value of the future award redemption obligation using statistical formulas that project future point redemptions based on factors that require judgment including an estimate of breakage points that will never be redeemed an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed and the cost of the points to be redeemed the cost of the points to be redeemed includes further estimates of available room nights occupancy rates room rates and any devaluation or appreciation of points based on changes in reward prices or changes in points earned per staywe had 963 million of guest loyalty liability as of december 31 2013 changes in the estimates used in developing our breakage rate could result in a material change to our guest loyalty liability a 10 percent decrease to the breakage estimate used in determining future award redemption obligations would increase our guest loyalty liability by approximately 30 millionallowance for loan lossesthe allowance for loan losses is related to the receivables generated by our financing of timeshare interval sales which are secured by the underlying timeshare properties we determine our timeshare financing receivables to be past due based on the contractual terms of the individual mortgage loans we use a technique referred to as static pool analysis as the basis for determining our general reserve requirements on our timeshare financing receivables the adequacy of the related allowance is determined by management through analysis of several factors requiring judgment such as current economic conditions and industry trends as well as the specific risk characteristics of the portfolio including assumed default rateswe had 92 million of allowance for loan losses as of december 31 2013 changes in the estimates used in developing our default rates could result in a material change to our allowance a 10 percent increase to our default rates used in the allowance calculation would increase our allowance for loan losses by approximately 35 millionincome taxeswe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates we regularly review our deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets that we believe will not be ultimately realized in performing this review we make estimates and assumptions regarding projected future taxable income the expected timing of reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies a change in these assumptions may increase or decrease our valuation allowance resulting in an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate which could materially affect our consolidated financial statementswe use a prescribed morelikelythannot recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return if there is uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements assumptions and estimates are used to determine the morelikelythannot designation changes to these assumptions and estimates can lead to an additional income tax expense benefit which can materially change our consolidated financial statements69legal contingencieswe are subject to various legal proceedings and claims the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required when we evaluate among other factors the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss changes in these factors could materially affect our consolidated financial statementsconsolidationswe use judgment when evaluating whether we have a controlling financial interest in our partnerships and other investments including the assessment of the importance of rights and privileges of the partners based on voting rights as well as financial interests that are not controllable through voting interests if the entity is considered to be a vie we use judgment determining whether we are the primary beneficiary and then consolidate those vies for which we have determined we are the primary beneficiary if the entity in which we hold an interest does not meet the definition of a vie we evaluate whether we have a controlling financial interest through our voting interests in the entity we consolidate entities when we own more than 50 percent of the voting shares of a company or have a controlling general partner interest of a partnership assuming the absence of other factors determining control including the ability of minority owners to participate in or block certain decisions changes to judgments used in evaluating our partnerships and other investments could materially affect our consolidated financial statementssharebased compensationin connection with our ipo the equity based portion of our former executive compensation plan was modified to vested shares and unvested restricted shares of common stock and the liability portion of the plan was settled in cash the equity based award was exchanged for vested shares and unvested restricted shares of our common stock as follows40 percent of each award vested on december 11 2013 the pricing date of our ipo40 percent of each award will vest on december 11 2014 the first anniversary of the pricing date of our ipo contingent upon continued employment through that date and20 percent of each award will vest on the date that our sponsor and its affiliates cease to own 50 percent or more of the shares of the company contingent upon continued employment through that datewe recognized sharebased compensation over the requisite service period of the individual grantee which generally equals the vesting period we currently only have service condition awards outstanding and we have elected to use the straightline method of expense attribution for such awards the process of estimating the fair value of stockbased compensation awards and recognizing the associated expense over the requisite service period involves significant management estimates and assumptions including forfeiture rates we monitor the forfeiture activity to ensure that the current estimate continues to be appropriate any changes to this estimate will affect the amount of compensation expense we recognize with respect to any future grants
