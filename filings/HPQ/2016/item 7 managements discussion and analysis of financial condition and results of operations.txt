hewlett packard enterprise is an independent public company trading on the new york stock exchange nyse under the symbol hpe after the separation we do not beneficially own any shares of hewlett packard enterprise common stock in connection with the separation we and hewlett packard enterprise have entered into a separation and distribution agreement as well as various other agreements that provide a framework for the relationships between hp and hewlett packard enterprise going forward including among others a tax matters agreement an employee matters agreement a transition service agreement a real estate matters agreement a master commercial agreement and an information technology service agreement 31hp inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis offinancial condition and results of operations continuedoverview we are a leading global provider of personal computing and other access devices imaging and printing products and related technologies solutions and services we sell to individual consumers small and mediumsized businesses and large enterprises including customers in the government health and education sectors we have three segments for financial reporting purposes personal systems printing and corporate investments the personal systems segment offers commercial personal computers pcs consumer pcs workstations thin clients commercial tablets and mobility devices retail pointofsale systems displays and other related accessories software support and services for the commercial and consumer markets the printing segment provides consumer and commercial printer hardware supplies media solutions and services as well as scanning devices corporate investments include hp labs and certain business incubation projectsin personal systems our strategic focus is on profitable growth through improved market segmentation with respect to enhanced innovation in multioperating systems multiarchitecture geography customer segments and other key attributes additionally hp is investing in premium and mobility form factors such as convertible notebooks detachable notebooks and commercial tablets and mobility devices in order to meet customer preference for mobile thinner and lighter devices we expect a decrease in the rate of the market decline and we believe that we are well positioned due to our competitive product lineupin printing our strategic focus is on business printing a shift to contractual solutions and graphics business printing includes delivering solutions to smb and enterprise customers such as multifunction and pagewide printers including our jetintelligence lineup of laserjet printers the shift to contractual solutions includes an increased focus on managed print services and instant ink which presents strong aftermarket supplies opportunities in the graphics space we are focused on innovations such as our indigo and latex product offerings we plan to continue to focus on shifting the mix in the installed base to higher value units and expanding our innovative ink laser and graphics and 3d printing programs we continue to execute on our key initiatives of focusing on products targeted at high usage categories and introducing new revenue delivery models our ink in the office initiative is continuing to shift the installed base to more valuable units in the commercial market our focus is on placing higher value printer units which offer positive annuity of toner and ink the design and deployment of a3 products and solutions accelerating growth in graphic solutions products and launching and developing our first 3d printers during the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 we announced our decision to make a onetime investment over time to reduce the level of supplies inventory across the channels this change in the supplies sales model supports our strategy of maintaining a more consistent value proposition by shifting from a push model to a pull model driven by market demand and allows for less price variability we continue to experience challenges that are representative of trends and uncertainties that may affect our business and results of operations one set of challenges relates to dynamic and accelerating market trends such as the decline in the pc device market and home printing a second set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape our primary competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others a third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our gotomarket execution in personal systems we are witnessing soft demand in the pc market as customers hold onto their pcs longer thereby extending pc refresh cycles demand for pcs is being impacted by weaker macroeconomic conditions and currency depreciation in latin america canada and certain asian and european markets as such we anticipate continued market headwindsin printing we are experiencing the impact of demand challenges in consumer and commercial markets we are also experiencing an overall competitive pricing environment and have yet to see evidence of a broad move for our japanese competitors to be less aggressive given the strength of the yen we obtain a number of components from single sources due to technology availability price quality or other considerations for instance we source laser printer engines and laser toner cartridges from canon any decision by either party to not renew our agreement with canon or to limit or reduce the scope of the agreement could adversely affect our net revenue from laserjet products however we have a longstanding business relationship with canon and do not anticipate nonrenewal of this agreement we may also face challenges as a result of the june 23 2016 referendum by british voters to exit the european union commonly known as brexit the outcome of brexit and its impact on our business cannot be known until the terms and 32hp inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis offinancial condition and results of operations continuedtiming of the united kingdoms exit are clearer until that time we may face various brexitrelated challenges that may include uncertainty in the markets volatility in exchange rates and weaker macroeconomic conditionsto address these challenges we continue to pursue innovation with a view towards developing new products and services aligned with generating market demand and meeting the needs of our customers and partners in addition we need to continue to improve our operations with a particular focus on enhancing our endtoend processes and efficiencies we also need to continue to optimize our sales coverage models align our sales incentives with our strategic goals improve channel execution strengthen our capabilities in our areas of strategic focus and develop and capitalize on market opportunities for a further discussion of trends uncertainties and other factors that could impact our continuing operating results see the section entitled risk factors in item 1a in this annual report on form 10kcritical accounting policies and estimates general the consolidated financial statements of hp are prepared in accordance with united states us generally accepted accounting principles gaap which require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of hps board of directors management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting amounts are reasonable however actual results may differ from these estimates making estimates and judgments about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows a summary of significant accounting policies is included in note 1 overview and summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services are rendered the sales price or fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured as well as when other revenue recognition principles are met including industryspecific revenue recognition guidance we enter into contracts to sell our products and services and while many of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions there are agreements we enter into which contain nonstandard terms and conditions further many of our arrangements include multiple elements as a result significant contract interpretation may be required to determine the appropriate accounting including the identification of deliverables considered to be separate units of accounting the allocation of the transaction price among elements in the arrangement and the timing of revenue recognition for each of those elements we recognize revenue for delivered elements as separate units of accounting when the delivered elements have standalone value to the customer for elements with no standalone value we recognize revenue consistent with the pattern of the delivery of the final deliverable if the arrangement includes a customernegotiated refund or return right or other contingency relative to the delivered items and the delivery and performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially within our control the delivered element constitutes a separate unit of accounting in arrangements with combined units of accounting changes in the allocation of the transaction price among elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition for the contract but will not change the total revenue recognized for the contract 33hp inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis offinancial condition and results of operations continuedwe establish the selling prices used for each deliverable based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe of selling price is not available or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe of selling price nor tpe is available we establish vsoe of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and in rare instances using the price established by management having the relevant authority we evaluate tpe of selling price by reviewing largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers esp is established based on managements judgment considering internal factors such as margin objectives pricing practices and controls customer segment pricing strategies and the product life cycle consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and industry technology life cycles we may modify or develop new gotomarket practices in the future which may result in changes in selling prices impacting both vsoe of selling price and esp in most arrangements with multiple elements the transaction price is allocated to the individual units of accounting at inception of the arrangement based on their relative selling price however the aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of the transaction price to deliverables in multiple element arrangements entered into in future periods this may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for identical arrangements executed in future periods but will not change the total revenue recognized for any given arrangement we reduce revenue for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings including price protection rebates promotions other volumebased incentives and expected returns future market conditions and product transitions may require us to take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered for certain incentive programs we estimate the number of customers expected to redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the incentive for hardware products we recognize revenue generated from direct sales to end customers and indirect sales to channel partners including resellers distributors and valueadded solution providers when the revenue recognition criteria are satisfied for indirect sales to channel partners we recognize revenue at the time of delivery when the channel partner has economic substance apart from hp and hp has completed its obligations related to the sale we recognize revenue from fixedprice support or maintenance contracts ratably over the contract period warranty we accrue the estimated cost of product warranties at the time we recognize revenue we evaluate our warranty obligations on a product group basis our standard product warranty terms generally include postsales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period of time while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers we base our estimated warranty obligation on contractual warranty terms repair costs product call rates average cost per call current period product shipments and ongoing product failure rates as well as specific product class failure outside of our baseline experience warranty terms generally range from 90 days to three years for parts labor and onsite services depending upon the product over the last three fiscal years the annual warranty expense and actual warranty costs have averaged approximately 22 and 25 of annual net revenue respectively restructuring and other charges we have engaged in restructuring actions which require management to estimate the timing and amount of severance and other employee separation costs for workforce reduction and enhanced early retirement programs fair value of assets made redundant or obsolete and the fair value of lease cancellation and other exit costs we accrue for severance and other employee separation costs under these actions when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable the rates used in determining severance accruals are based on existing plans historical experiences and negotiated settlements other charges include nonrecurring costs that are distinct from ongoing operational costs such as information technology costs incurred in connection with the separation for a full description of our restructuring actions refer to our discussions of restructuring in results of operations below and in note 4 restructuring and other charges to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which are incorporated herein by reference retirement and postretirement benefits our pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions our major assumptions relate primarily to discount rates mortality rates expected increases in compensation levels and the expected long34hp inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis offinancial condition and results of operations continuedterm return on plan assets the discount rate assumption is based on current investment yields of highquality fixedincome securities with maturities similar to the expected benefits payment period mortality rates help predict the expected life of plan participants and are based on a historical demographic study of the plan the expected increase in the compensation levels assumption reflects our longterm actual experience and future expectations the expected longterm return on plan assets is determined based on asset allocations historical portfolio results historical asset correlations and managements expected returns for each asset class we evaluate our expected return assumptions annually including reviewing current capital market assumptions to assess the reasonableness of the expected longterm return on plan assets we update the expected longterm return on assets when we observe a sufficient level of evidence that would suggest the longterm expected return has changed in any fiscal year significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected longterm return on plan assets historically differences between the actual return and expected longterm return on plan assets have resulted from changes in target or actual asset allocation shortterm performance relative to expected longterm performance and to a lesser extent differences between target and actual investment allocations the timing of benefit payments compared to expectations and the use of derivatives intended to effect asset allocation changes or hedge certain investment or liability exposures for the recognition of net periodic benefit cost the calculation of the expected longterm return on plan assets uses the fair value of plan assets as of the beginning of the fiscal year unless updated as a result of interim remeasurement our major assumptions vary by plan and the weightedaverage rates used are set forth in note 5 retirement and postretirement benefit plans to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference the following table provides the impact a change of 25 basis points in each of the weightedaverage assumptions of the discount rate expected increase in compensation levels and expected longterm return on plan assets would have had on our net periodic benefit cost for fiscal year 2016  change in net periodicbenefit cost in millionsassumptions discount rate9expected increase in compensation levels2expected longterm return on plan assets31 taxes on earnings we calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the final positions reflected in our income tax returns we adjust our current and deferred tax provisions based on income tax returns which are generally filed in the third or fourth quarters of the subsequent fiscal year we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize in determining the need for a valuation allowance we consider future market growth forecasted earnings future taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in the event we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future we would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a corresponding charge to earnings or other comprehensive income in the period in which we make such a determination likewise if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the deferred tax assets we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation allowance in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are locatedour effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not provided united states federal taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the united states we plan distributions of foreign earnings based on projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and longterm investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations based on these assumptions we estimate the amount we expect to indefinitely invest outside the united states and the amounts we expect to distribute to the united states and provide the united 35hp inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis offinancial condition and results of operations continuedstates federal taxes due on amounts expected to be distributed to the united states further as a result of certain employment actions and capital investments we have undertaken income from manufacturing activities in certain jurisdictions is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from taxes for fiscal years through 2027 material changes in our estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact how future earnings are repatriated to the united states and our related future effective tax rate we are subject to income taxes in the united states and approximately 58 other countries and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions we believe that positions taken on our tax returns are fully supported but tax authorities may challenge these positions which may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities accordingly our income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges determining the income tax provision for these potential assessments and recording the related effects requires management judgments and estimates the amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and therefore could have a material impact on our income tax provision net income and cash flows our accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our international operations including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions intercompany transactions and related interest for a further discussion on taxes on earnings refer to note 7 taxes on earnings to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference inventory we state our inventory at the lower of cost or market on a firstin firstout basis we make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value at the product group level for estimated excess or obsolescence factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand technological changes product life cycle and development plans component cost trends product pricing physical deterioration and quality issues goodwill we review goodwill for impairment annually during our fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable we can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting units goodwill for impairment or we can directly perform the twostep impairment test based on the qualitative assessment if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not ie a likelihood of more than 50 percent to be less than its carrying amount the twostep impairment test will be performed in the first step of the impairment test we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount with the fair values derived most significantly from the income approach and to a lesser extent the market approach under the income approach we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows we base cash flow projections on managements estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins taking into consideration industry and market conditions we base the discount rate on the weightedaverage cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with businessspecific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting units ability to execute on the projected cash flows under the market approach we estimate fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publiclytraded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit we weight the fair value derived from the market approach depending on the level of comparability of these publiclytraded companies to the reporting unit when market comparables are not meaningful or not available we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using only the income approachif the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss if any in the second step we measure the reporting units assets including any unrecognized intangible assets liabilities and noncontrolling interests at fair value in a hypothetical analysis to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill for the reporting unit in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination if the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is less than its carrying amount the difference is recorded as an impairment lossour annual goodwill impairment analysis performed using the qualitative assessment option as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 resulted in a conclusion that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting 36hp inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis offinancial condition and results of operations continuedunits exceeded their respective carrying values as a result we concluded that the first step of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary  fair value of derivative instruments we use derivative instruments to manage a variety of risks including risks related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we use forwards swaps and at times options to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures we do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes as of october 31 2016 the gross notional value of our derivative portfolio was 179 billion assets and liabilities related to derivative instruments are measured at fair value and were 325 million and 97 million respectively as of october 31 2016 fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date the determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to the asset or liability being valued we generally use industry standard valuation models to measure the fair value of our derivative positions when prices in active markets are not available for the identical asset or liability we use industry standard valuation models to measure fair value where applicable these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to present value using marketbased observable inputs including interest rate curves hp and counterparty credit risk foreign currency exchange rates and forward and spot prices for a further discussion on fair value measurements and derivative instruments refer to note 10 fair value and note 11 financial instruments respectively to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which are incorporated herein by reference loss contingencies we are involved in various lawsuits claims investigations and proceedings including those consisting of intellectual property ip commercial securities employment employee benefits and environmental matters that arise in the ordinary course of business we record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine both the probability of having incurred a liability and the estimated amount of the liability we review these matters at least quarterly and adjust these liabilities to reflect the impact of negotiations settlements rulings advice of legal counsel and other updated information and events pertaining to a particular case pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement we share responsibility with hewlett packard enterprise for certain matters as discussed in note 15 litigation and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference and hewlett packard enterprise has agreed to indemnify us in whole or in part with respect to certain matters based on our experience we believe that any damage amounts claimed in the specific litigation and contingencies matters further discussed in note 15 litigation and contingencies are not a meaningful indicator of hps potential liability litigation is inherently unpredictable however we believe we have valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us nevertheless cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies we believe we have recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and as of october 31 2016 it was not reasonably possible that a material loss had been incurred in excess of the amounts recognized in our financial statementsrecent accounting pronouncements for a summary of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our consolidated financial statements see note 1 overview

discussion and analysis offinancial condition and results of operations continuedrevenue from our international operations has historically represented and we expect will continue to represent a majority of our overall net revenue as a result our net revenue growth has been impacted and we expect it will continue to be impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in order to provide a framework for assessing performance excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations we supplementally present the yearoveryear percentage change in net revenue on a constant currency basis which assumes no change in foreign currency exchange rates from the prioryear period and does not adjust for any repricing or demand impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates this
