overviewwe design make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world our business model is carefully constructed around several advantages that are unique to tiindustrys broadest portfolio of differentiated analog and embedded processing semiconductors   our customers design engineers need at least one and most times multiple chips for their systems the breadth of our portfolio means we can solve more of these needs than can our competitors which gives us access to more customers and the opportunity to generate more revenue per system we invest more than 1 billion each year to develop new products for our portfolioa strong foundation of manufacturing technology and lowcost production we invest in manufacturing technologies that differentiate the features of our semiconductors and we do most of our own production inhouse as opposed to outsourcing it this ability to directly control our manufacturing helps ensure a consistent supply of products for our customers we produce billions of semiconductors each year on a mixture of 150 200 and 300millimeter wafers and we are able to keep costs low for manufacturing facilities and equipment because our analog and much of our embedded processing semiconductors can be made using mature assets that we acquire ahead of demand when their prices are most attractive in 2014 we produced approximately 25 percent of our analog semiconductors on 300millimeter wafers the industrys largest wafers which have a 40 percent cost advantage per unpackaged chip over 200millimeter wafers the majority of our future analog growth will be produced on 300millimeter wafers which will be meaningful to the growth of our margins and cash flow over the long termindustrys largest market channels our global sales force is larger than those of our competitors and the breadth of our portfolio attracts tens of millions of visits to our web site each year where customers often begin their initial product searches and designin journey these capabilities combine to provide us unique access to more than 100000 customersdiversity and longevity in our products and in the markets we serve together the advantages above result in diverse and longlived positions that deliver high terminal value to our shareholders because of the breadth of our portfolio we are not dependent on any single product and because of the breadth of our markets we are not dependent on any single application or customer some of our products generate revenue for decades which strengthens the return on our investmentsthese advantages have resulted in consistent share gains and free cash flow growth and they put us in a unique class of companies with the ability to grow generate cash and return that cash to shareholders managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mdampa should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document in the following discussion of our results of operationsall dollar amounts in the tables are stated in millions of us dollars except pershare amountswhen we discuss our resultsunless otherwise noted changes in our revenue are attributable to changes in customer demand which are evidenced by fluctuations in shipment volumes new products tend not to have a significant impact on our revenue in any given period because we sell such a large number of productsfrom time to time our revenue and gross profit are affected by changes in demand for higherpriced or lowerpriced products which we refer to as changes in the mix of products shippedbecause we own much of our manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed when factory loadings decrease our fixed costs are spread over reduced output and absent other circumstances our profit margins decrease conversely as factory loadings increase our fixed costs are spread over increased output and absent other circumstances our profit margins increase increases and decreases in factory loadings tend to correspond to increases and decreases in demand17our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements product characteristics manufacturing processes and distribution channels and how management allocates resources and measures results see note 1 to the financial statements for more information regarding our segmentsour exit from legacy wireless products and the elimination effective january 1 2013 of the wireless segment resulted in changes to our corporatelevel expense allocations which negatively affected analog and embedded processing profitability in the year ended december 31 2013 and to a less significant extent in 2014 we allocate our corporatelevel expenses which are largely fixed among our product lines in proportion to the operating expenses directly generated by them legacy wireless products generated lower operating expenses in 2014 and 2013 than in 2012 because we stopped investing in them the corporatelevel expenses allocated to those products were therefore proportionately lower and the corporatelevel expenses allocated to the remaining product lines were proportionately higher this allocation change affects the profitability of each of our segments but does not impact operating expense or profitability trends at the consolidated levelresults of operationswe continued to perform well in 2014 reflecting our focus on analog and embedded processing semiconductors we believe these products serve highly diverse markets with thousands of applications and have dependable longterm growth opportunities in 2014 analog revenue grew 13 percent and embedded processing revenue grew 12 percent these two segments represented 83 percent of ti revenue for the year up from 79 percent in 2013 gross margin of 569 percent for the year reflects the diversity and longevity of our product portfolio as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy our business model focused on analog and embedded processing allows us to generate strong cash flow from operations in 2014 free cash flow was 27 percent of revenue up 3 percentage points from a year ago during the year we returned 42 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividendsfree cash flow

projections beyond 2015 are not practical to estimate due to the rules affecting taxdeductible contributions and the impact from the plans asset performance interest rates and potential us and nonus legislation critical accounting policiesin preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we use statistical analyses estimates and projections that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures and may vary from actual results we consider the following accounting policies to be both those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and that require the most subjective judgment if actual results differ significantly from managements estimates and projections there could be a significant effect on our financial statementsrevenue recognitionwe recognize revenue from sales of our products including direct sales to our distributors when title and risk of loss pass which usually occurs upon shipment or delivery to the customer or distributor depending upon the terms of the sales order when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists when sales amounts are fixed or determinable and when collectability is reasonably assured for sales to distributors payment is due on our standard commercial terms and is not contingent upon resale of the products in 2014 about 60 percent of our revenue was generated from sales of our products to distributorswe recognize revenue net of allowances which are managements estimates of future credits to be granted to customers or distributors under programs common in the semiconductor industry these allowances are based on analysis of historical data current economic conditions and contractual terms and are recorded when revenue is recognized allowances may include volumebased incentives product returns due to quality issues incentives designed to maximize growth opportunities and special pricing arrangements for instance we sell to distributors at standard published prices but we may grant them price adjustment credits in response to individual competitive opportunities to estimate allowances we use statistical percentages of revenue which are determined quarterly based upon recent historical adjustment trends historical claims data are maintained for each of the programs with differences among geographic regions taken into consideration we continually monitor the actual claimed allowances against our estimates and we adjust our estimates as appropriate to reflect trends in distributor revenue and inventory levels allowances are also adjusted when recent historical data do not represent anticipated future activity we may also provide distributors an allowance to scrap certain slowselling or obsolete products in their inventory estimated as a negotiated fixed percentage of each distributors purchases from us in addition if we publish a new price for a product that is lower than that paid by distributors for the same product still remaining in each distributors onhand inventory we may credit 23them for the difference between those prices the allowance for this type of credit is based on the identified product price difference applied to our estimate of each distributors onhand inventory of that productwe believe we can reasonably and reliably estimate allowances for credits to distributors in a timely manner revenue from sales of our products that are subject to inventory consignment agreements including consignment arrangements with distributors is recognized in accordance with the principles discussed above but delivery occurs when the customer or distributor pulls product from consignment inventory that we store at designated locations about 60 percent of our distributor revenue is generated from sales of consigned inventory the allowances we record against this revenue are not materialwe determine the amount and timing of royalty revenue based on our contractual agreements with intellectual property licensees we recognize royalty revenue when earned under the terms of the agreements and when we consider realization of payment to be probable in addition we record allowances for accounts receivable that we estimate may not be collected we monitor collectability of accounts receivable primarily through review of the accounts receivable aging when collection is at risk we assess the impact on amounts recorded for bad debts and if necessary will record a charge in the period such determination is made we include amounts received from customers for reimbursement of shipping fees in revenue we include the costs of shipping and handling in cor income taxesin determining net income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax provisions and the resultant tax liabilities and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expensein the ordinary course of global business there may be many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due although we believe the estimates are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accrualsas part of our financial process we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered if recovery is not likely the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to be ultimately recoverable in this process certain relevant criteria are evaluated including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets the taxable income in prior years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and credit carrybacks and taxable income in future years our judgment regarding future recoverability of our deferred tax assets based on these criteria may change due to various factors including changes in us or international tax laws and changes in market conditions and their impact on our assessment of taxable income in future periods these changes if any may require material adjustments to the deferred tax assets and an accompanying reduction or increase in net income in the period when such determinations are made also our plans for the permanent reinvestment or eventual repatriation of the accumulated earnings of certain of our nonus operations could change such changes could have a material effect on tax expense in future years in addition to the factors described above the effective tax rate reflected in forwardlooking statements is based on thencurrent tax law significant changes in tax law enacted during the year could affect these estimates retroactive changes in tax law enacted subsequent to the end of a reporting period are reflected in the period of enactment as a discrete tax item inventory valuation allowancesinventory is valued net of allowances for unsalable or obsolete raw materials workinprocess and finished goods statistical allowances are determined quarterly for raw materials and workinprocess based on historical disposals of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons for finished goods quarterly statistical allowances are determined by comparing inventory levels of individual parts to historical shipments current backlog and estimated future sales in order to identify inventory judged unlikely to be sold a specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is a significant event not captured by the statistical allowance examples are an endoflife part or demand with imminent risk of cancellation allowances are also calculated quarterly for instances where inventoried costs for individual products are in excess of market prices for those products actual future writeoffs of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons may differ from estimates and calculations used to determine valuation allowances due to changes in customer demand customer negotiations technology shifts and other factors24impairment of acquisitionrelated intangibles and goodwillwe review acquisitionrelated intangible assets for impairment when certain indicators suggest an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable factors considered include the assets underperformance compared with expectations and shortened useful life due to planned changes in its use recoverability is determined by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flow if the future undiscounted cash flow is less than the carrying amount an impairment charge would be recognized for the excess of the carrying amount over fair value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique additionally in the case of an intangible asset that will continue to be used in future periods a shortened useful life may be utilized if appropriate resulting in accelerated amortization based upon the expected net realizable value of the asset at the date the asset will no longer be utilizedwe review goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if certain impairment indicators arise such as significant changes in business climate operating performance or competition or upon the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred between annual test dates this impairment review compares the fair value for each reporting unit containing goodwill to its carrying value determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows discount rates based on weighted average cost of capital and future economic and market conditions we base our fairvalue estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonableactual cash flow amounts for future periods may differ from estimates used in impairment testingchanges in accounting standardssee note 2 to the financial statements for
