    the section below discusses the most significant risk factors that may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition  as set forth below we believe that the risks facing our company generally fall into the following categories   risks related to our business and  risks related to tax matters including reitrelated risks    risks related to our business   volatility or disruption in the financial markets may impair our ability to raise capital obtain new financing or refinance existing obligations and fund real estate and development activities   the global financial markets recently have experienced pervasive and fundamental disruptions while these conditions have stabilized since the first quarter of 2009 and the capital markets generally have shown signs of improvement the sustainability of an economic recovery is uncertain and additional levels of market disruption and volatility could materially adversely impact our ability to raise capital obtain new financing or refinance our existing obligations as they mature and fund real estate and development activities   market volatility could also lead to significant uncertainty in the valuation of our investments and those of our joint ventures that may result in a substantial decrease in the value of our properties and those of our joint ventures as a result we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of such investments and the associated goodwill if any which may require us to recognize impairment charges in earnings   we rely on external sources of capital to fund future capital needs and limitations on our access to such capital could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments as they become due or make future investments necessary to grow our business   we may not be able to fund all future capital needs from cash retained from operations if we are unable to obtain enough internal capital we may need to rely on external sources of capital including debt and equity financing to fulfill our capital requirements if we cannot access these external sources of capital we may not be able to make the investments needed to grow our business and to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature our access to capital depends upon a number of factors some of which we have little or no control over including but not limited to   general availability of credit and market conditions including rising interest rates and increased borrowing cost   the market price of the shares of our equity securities and the credit ratings of our debt and preferred securities   the markets perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions   our degree of financial leverage and operational flexibility  the financial integrity of our lenders which might impair their ability to meet their commitments to us or their willingness to make additional loans to us and our inability to replace the financing commitment of any such lender on favorable terms or at all  the stability in the market value of our properties   13      table of contents   the financial performance and general market perception of our operators tenants and borrowers   changes in the credit ratings on us government debt securities or default or delay in payment by the united states of its obligations and  issues facing the healthcare industry including but not limited to healthcare reform and changes in government reimbursement policies    if our access to capital is limited by these factors or other factors it could have a material adverse impact on our ability to fund operations refinance our debt obligations fund dividend payments acquire properties and development activities   adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms if at all and negatively impact the market price of our securities including our common stock   the credit ratings of our senior unsecured debt are based on our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analyses of us our credit ratings can affect the amount and type of capital we can access as well as the terms of any financings we may obtain there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and in the event that our current credit ratings deteriorate we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and it may be more difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments also a downgrade in our credit ratings would trigger additional costs or other potentially negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments   our level of indebtedness may increase and materially adversely affect our future operations   our outstanding indebtedness as of december 31 2012 was approximately 87 billion we may incur additional indebtedness in the future including in connection with the development or acquisition of assets which may be substantial any significant additional indebtedness could negatively affect the credit ratings of our debt and require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to interest and principal payments due on our indebtedness greater demands on our cash resources may reduce funds available to us to pay dividends conduct development activities make capital expenditures and acquisitions or carry out other aspects of our business strategy increased indebtedness can also limit our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and create competitive disadvantages for us compared to other companies with relatively lower debt levels increased future debt service obligations may limit our operational flexibility including our ability to finance or refinance our properties contribute properties to joint ventures or sell properties as needed   covenants related to our indebtedness limit our operational flexibility and breaches of these covenants could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition   our unsecured credit facilities unsecured debt securities and secured debt and other indebtedness that we may incur in the future require or will require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants such as maintaining certain levels of debt service coverage and leverage ratio tangible net worth requirements and maintaining reit status our continued ability to incur additional debt and to conduct business in general is subject to compliance with these financial and other covenants which limit our operational flexibility for example mortgages on our properties contain customary covenants such as those that limit or restrict our ability without the consent of the lender to further encumber or sell the applicable properties or to replace the applicable tenant or operator breaches of certain covenants may result in defaults under the mortgages on our properties  14      table of contents and crossdefaults under certain of our other indebtedness even if we satisfy our payment obligations to the respective obligee additionally defaults under the leases or operating agreements related to mortgaged properties including defaults associated with the bankruptcy of the applicable tenant or operator may result in a default under the underlying mortgage and crossdefaults under certain of our other indebtedness covenants that limit our operational flexibility as well as defaults under our debt instruments could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition   an increase in interest rates could increase interest cost on new debt and could materially adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt sell assets and limit our acquisition investment and development activities   if interest rates increase so could our interest costs for any new debt this increased cost could make the financing of any acquisition and development activity more costly rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing and increase interest expense on refinanced indebtedness in addition an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our assets thereby limiting our ability to reposition our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions   we depend on a limited number of operators and tenants that account for a large percentage of our revenues   during the year ended december 31 2012 approximately 48 of our revenues were generated by our leasing or financial arrangements with the following four companies hcr manorcare 30 emeritus 8 sunrise 5 and brookdale 5 the failure inability or unwillingness of these operators or tenants to meet their obligations to us could materially reduce our cash flow as well as our results of operations which could in turn reduce the amount of dividends we pay cause our stock price to decline and have other material adverse effects on our business results of operations and financial condition   in addition any failure by these operators or tenants to effectively conduct their operations or to maintain and improve our properties could adversely affect their business reputation and their ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition these operators and tenants generally have also agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses and we cannot provide any assurance that they will have sufficient assets income access to financing and insurance coverage to enable it to satisfy its indemnification obligations   economic and other conditions that negatively affect geographic areas to which a greater percentage of our revenue is attributed could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition   for the year ended december 31 2012 approximately 44 of our revenue was derived from properties located in california 22 texas 12 and florida 10 as a result we are subject to increased exposure to adverse conditions affecting these regions including downturns in the local economies or changes in local real estate conditions increased competition or decreased demand and changes in statespecific legislation which could adversely affect our business and results of operations   the bankruptcy insolvency or financial deterioration of one or more of our major operators or tenants may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition   we lease our properties directly to operators in most cases and in certain other cases we lease to thirdparty tenants who enter into longterm management agreements with operators to manage the  15      table of contents properties although our leases financing arrangements and other agreements with our tenants and operators generally provide us the right under specified circumstances to terminate a lease evict an operator or tenant or demand immediate repayment of certain obligations to us the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization that may render certain of these remedies unenforceable or at the least delay our ability to pursue such remedies for example we cannot evict a tenant or operator solely because of its bankruptcy filing a debtor has the right to assume or to assume and assign to a third party or to reject its unexpired contracts in a bankruptcy proceeding if a debtor were to reject its leases with us our claim against the debtor for unpaid and future rents would be limited by the statutory cap set forth in the us bankruptcy code which may be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease in addition the inability of our tenants or operators to make payments or comply with certain other lease obligations may affect our compliance with certain covenants contained in our debt securities credit facilities and the mortgages on the properties leased or managed by such tenants and operators in addition under certain conditions defaults under the underlying mortgages may result in crossdefault under our other indebtedness although we believe that we would be able to secure amendments under the applicable agreements in those circumstances the bankruptcy of an applicable operator or tenant may potentially result in less favorable borrowing terms than currently available delays in the availability of funding or other material adverse consequences in addition many of our facilities are leased to healthcare providers who provide longterm custodial care to the elderly evicting such operators for failure to pay rent while the facility is occupied may be a difficult and slow process and may not be successful   our operators and tenants may not procure the necessary insurance to adequately insure against losses   our leases generally require our tenants and operators to secure and maintain comprehensive liability and property insurance that covers us as well as the tenants and operators some types of losses may not be adequately insured by our tenants and operators should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur we could incur liability or lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property in such an event we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property we continually review the insurance maintained by our tenants and operators and believe the coverage provided to be customary for similarly situated companies in our industry however we cannot assure you that material uninsured losses or losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future   our operators and tenants are faced with litigation and may experience rising liability and insurance costs   in some states advocacy groups have been created to monitor the quality of care at healthcare facilities and these groups have brought litigation against the operators and tenants of such facilities also in several instances private litigation by patients has succeeded in winning large damage awards for alleged abuses the effect of this litigation and other potential litigation may materially increase the costs incurred by our operators and tenants for monitoring and reporting quality of care compliance in addition their cost of liability and medical malpractice insurance can be significant and may increase so long as the present healthcare litigation environment continues cost increases could cause our operators to be unable to make their lease or mortgage payments or fail to purchase the appropriate liability and malpractice insurance potentially decreasing our revenues and increasing our collection and litigation costs in addition as a result of our ownership of healthcare facilities we may be named as a defendant in lawsuits allegedly arising from the actions of our operators or tenants for which claims such operators and tenants have agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against but which may require unanticipated expenditures on our part  16      table of contents  operators and tenants that fail to comply with the requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid may cease to operate or be unable to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us   certain of our operators and tenants are affected by an extremely complex set of federal state and local laws and regulations that are subject to frequent and substantial changes sometimes applied retroactively resulting from legislation adoption of rules and regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing law see item 1businessgovernment regulation licensing and enforcement above for example to the extent that any of our operators or tenants receive a significant portion of their revenues from governmental payors primarily medicare and medicaid such revenues may be subject to   statutory and regulatory changes  retroactive rate adjustments  recovery of program overpayments or setoffs  administrative rulings  policy interpretations  payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers  government funding restrictions at a program level or with respect to specific facilities and   interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing governmental investigations and audits at such property    in recent years governmental payors have frozen or reduced payments to healthcare providers due to budgetary pressures healthcare reimbursement will likely continue to be of significant importance to federal and state authorities we cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or the effect that any future legislative reforms may have on our operators and tenants costs of doing business and on the amount of reimbursement by government and other thirdparty payors the failure of any of our operators or tenants to comply with these laws requirements and regulations could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and contractual obligations to us   legislation to address the federal governments projected operating deficit could have a material adverse effect on our operators liquidity financial condition or results of operations   congress may consider legislation to address the fiscal condition of the united states that may include entitlement reform tax reform reductions in domestic discretionary spending budget sequestration of certain nondefense discretionary federal programs and an increase in the national debt limit that could have a material adverse effect on our operators liquidity financial condition or results of operations in particular congress may consider legislation affecting the funding of entitlement programs such as medicare medicaid and medicare advantage plans that may result in reductions in funding and reimbursements to providers tax reform that may impact corporate and individual tax rates and retirement plans and an increase in the federal debt limit that may have an impact on credit markets additionally the administration may implement proposals under current law or legislation that may be approved by congress that could modify the delivery of services and benefits under medicare medicaid or medicare advantage plans such changes could have a material adverse effect on our operators liquidity financial condition or results of operations which could adversely affect their ability to satisfy their obligations to us and could have a material adverse effect on us  17      table of contents  operators and tenants that fail to comply with federal state and local licensure certification and inspection laws and regulations may cease to operate or be unable to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us   certain of our operators and tenants are subject to extensive federal state local and industryrelated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards our operators or tenants failure to comply with any of these laws regulations or standards could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension or decertification from federal and state healthcare programs loss of license or closure of the facility for example certain of our properties may require a license registration andor certificate of need to operate failure of any operator or tenant to obtain a license registration or certificate of need or loss of a required license registration or certificate of need would prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by such operator or tenant additionally failure of our operators and tenants to generally comply with applicable laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on facilities owned by or mortgaged to us and therefore may materially adversely impact us see item 1businessgovernment regulation licensing and enforcementhealthcare licensure and certificate of need above   increased competition as well as an inability to grow revenues as originally forecast have resulted and may further result in lower net revenues for some of our operators and tenants and may affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us   the healthcare industry is highly competitive and can become more competitive in the future the occupancy levels at and rental income from our facilities is dependent on our ability and the ability of our operators and tenants to maintain and increase such levels and income and to compete with entities that have substantial capital resources these entities compete with other operators and tenants on a number of different levels including the quality of care provided reputation the physical appearance of a facility price the range of services offered family preference alternatives for healthcare delivery the supply of competing properties physicians staff referral sources location and the size and demographics of the population in the surrounding area private federal and state payment programs and the effect of laws and regulations may also have a significant influence on the profitability of the properties and their tenants our operators and tenants also compete with numerous other companies providing similar healthcare services or alternatives such as home health agencies life care at home communitybased service programs retirement communities and convalescent centers such competition which has intensified due to overbuilding in some segments in which we invest has caused the occupancy rate of newly constructed buildings to slow and the monthly rate that many newly built and previously existing facilities were able to obtain for their services to decrease we cannot be certain that the operators and tenants of all of our facilities will be able to achieve occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us further many competing companies may have resources and attributes that are superior to those of our operators and tenants thus our operators and tenants may encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to maintain or attract residents or expand their businesses which could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us potentially decreasing our revenues impairing our assets and increasing our collection and dispute costs   our tenants in the life science industry face high levels of regulation expense and uncertainty   life science tenants particularly those involved in developing and marketing pharmaceutical products are subject to certain unique risks as follows   some of our tenants require significant outlays of funds for the research development and clinical testing of their products and technologies if private investors the government or other sources of funding are unavailable to support such activities a tenants business may be adversely affected or fail   18      table of contents   the research development clinical testing manufacture and marketing of some of our tenants products require federal state and foreign regulatory approvals which may be costly or difficult to obtain  even after a life science tenant gains regulatory approval and market acceptance the product may still present significant regulatory and liability risks including among others the possible later discovery of safety concerns competition from new products and ultimately the expiration of patent protection for the product  our tenants with marketable products may be adversely affected by healthcare reform and the reimbursement policies of government or private healthcare payors and  our tenants may be unable to adequately protect their intellectual property under patent copyright or trade secret laws    we cannot assure you that our life science tenants will be successful in their businesses if our tenants businesses are adversely affected they may have difficulty making payments to us which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition   we may be unable to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estaterelated loans and even if we are successful in our foreclosure efforts we may be unable to successfully operate occupy or reposition the underlying real estate which may adversely affect our ability to recover our investments   if an operator or tenant defaults under one of our mortgages or mezzanine loans we may have to foreclose on the loan or protect our interest by acquiring title to the collateral and thereafter making substantial improvements or repairs in order to maximize the propertys investment potential in some cases as noted above the collateral consists of the equity interests in an entity that directly or indirectly owns the applicable real property or interests in operating facilities and accordingly we may not have full recourse to assets of that entity operators tenants or borrowers may contest enforcement of foreclosure or other remedies seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other remedies andor bring claims for lender liability in response to actions to enforce mortgage obligations foreclosurerelated costs high loantovalue ratios or declines in the value of the facility may prevent us from realizing an amount equal to our mortgage or mezzanine loan upon foreclosure and we may be required to record valuation allowance for such losses even if we are able to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estaterelated loans we may inherit properties for which we may be unable to expeditiously seek tenants or operators if at all which would adversely affect our ability to fully recover our investment   required regulatory approvals can delay or prohibit transfers of our healthcare facilities   transfers of healthcare facilities to successor tenants or operators may be subject to regulatory approvals or ratifications including but not limited to change of ownership approvals under certificate of need laws and medicare and medicaid provider arrangements that are not required for transfers of other types of commercial operations and other types of real estate the replacement of any tenant or operator could be delayed by the regulatory approval process of any federal state or local government agency necessary for the transfer of the facility or the replacement of the operator licensed to manage the facility if we are unable to find a suitable replacement tenant or operator upon favorable terms or at all we may take possession of a facility which might expose us to successor liability or require us to indemnify subsequent operators to whom we might transfer the operating rights and licenses all of which may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition  19      table of contents  competition may make it difficult to identify and purchase or develop suitable healthcare facilities to grow our investment portfolio   we face significant competition from other reits investment companies private equity and hedge fund investors sovereign funds healthcare operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some of whom may have greater resources and lower costs of capital than we do increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our business goals and could improve the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell thereby impeding our investment acquisition and development activities if we cannot capitalize on our development pipeline identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of healthcare facilities at favorable prices or if we are unable to finance acquisitions on commercially favorable terms our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected   we may be required to incur substantial renovation costs to make certain of our healthcare properties suitable for other operators and tenants   healthcare facilities are typically highly customized and may not be easily adapted to nonhealthcarerelated uses the improvements generally required to conform a property to healthcare use such as upgrading electrical gas and plumbing infrastructure are costly and at times tenantspecific a new or replacement operator or tenant may require different features in a property depending on that operators or tenants particular operations if a current operator or tenant is unable to pay rent and vacates a property we may incur substantial expenditures to modify a property before we are able to secure another operator or tenant also if the property needs to be renovated to accommodate multiple operators or tenants we may incur substantial expenditures before we are able to release the space these expenditures or renovations may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition  20                   table of contents   we face additional risks associated with property development that can render a project less profitable or not profitable at all and under certain circumstances prevent completion of development activities once undertaken   largescale groundup development of healthcare properties presents additional risks for us including risks that   a development opportunity may be abandoned after expending significant resources resulting in the loss of deposits or failure to recover expenses already incurred  the development and construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates due to increased interest rates and higher materials transportation labor leasing or other costs which could make the completion of the development project less profitable  construction andor permanent financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all   the project may not be completed on schedule which can result in increases in construction costs and debt service expenses as a result of a variety of factors that are beyond our control including natural disasters labor conditions material shortages regulatory hurdles civil unrest and acts of war and   occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not meet expected levels and could be insufficient to make the property profitable    these risks could result in substantial unanticipated delays or expenses and under certain circumstances could prevent completion of development activities once undertaken any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition   our use of joint ventures may limit our flexibility with jointly owned investments   we have and may continue in the future to develop andor acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures our participation in joint ventures is subject to risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership including   we could experience an impasse on certain decisions because we do not have sole decisionmaking authority which could require us to expend additional resources on resolving such impasses or potential disputes including litigation or arbitration  our joint venture partners could have investment goals that are not consistent with our investment objectives including the timing terms and strategies for any investments  our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted   our joint venture partners might become bankrupt fail to fund their share of required capital contributions or fail to fulfill their obligations as a joint venture partner which may require us to infuse our own capital into the venture on behalf of the partner despite other competing uses for such capital and   our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of interest issues    from time to time we acquire other companies and if we are unable to successfully integrate these operations our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected   acquisitions require the integration of companies that have previously operated independently successful integration of the operations of these companies depends primarily on our ability to consolidate operations systems procedures properties and personnel and to eliminate redundancies and costs we may encounter difficulties in these integrations potential difficulties associated with  21      table of contents acquisitions include the loss of key employees the disruption of our ongoing business or that of the acquired entity possible inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies and the assumption of unexpected liabilities including   liabilities relating to the cleanup or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions   unasserted claims of vendors or other persons dealing with the seller  liabilities claims and litigation whether or not incurred in the ordinary course of business relating to periods prior to our acquisition  claims for indemnification by general partners directors officers and others indemnified by the seller and   liabilities for taxes relating to periods prior to our acquisition    in addition the acquired companies and their properties may fail to perform as expected including in respect of estimated cost savings inaccurate assumptions regarding future rental or occupancy rates could result in overly optimistic estimates of future revenues similarly we may underestimate future operating expenses or the costs necessary to bring properties up to standards established for their intended use if we have difficulties with any of these areas or if we later discover additional liabilities or experience unforeseen costs relating to our acquired companies we might not achieve the economic benefits we expect from our acquisitions and this may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition   from time to time we have made and in the future we may seek to make one or more material acquisitions which may involve the expenditure of significant funds   we regularly review potential transactions in order to maximize shareholder value and believe that currently there are available a number of acquisition opportunities that would be complementary to our business given the recent industry consolidation trend in connection with our review of such transactions we regularly engage in discussions with potential acquisition candidates some of which are material any future acquisitions could require the issuance of securities the incurrence of debt assumption of contingent liabilities or incurrence of significant expenditures any of which could materially adversely impact our business financial condition or results of operations in addition the financing required for such acquisitions may not be available on commercially favorable terms or at all   loss of our key personnel could temporarily disrupt our operations and adversely affect us   we are dependent on the efforts of our executive officers and competition for these individuals is intense although our chief executive officer chief financial officer chief investment officer and general counsel have employment agreements with us we cannot assure you that they will remain employed with us the loss or limited availability of the services of any of our executive officers or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future could at least temporarily have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition and be negatively perceived in the capital markets   unfavorable resolution of litigation matters and disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition   from time to time we are involved in legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims we may also be named as defendants in lawsuits allegedly arising out of our actions or the actions of our operators and tenants in which such operators and tenants have agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses an unfavorable resolution of litigation may have a material adverse effect on our  22      table of contents business results of operations and financial condition regardless of its outcome litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of management there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail in or achieve a favorable settlement of litigation in addition litigation government proceedings or environmental matters could lead to increased costs or interruption of our normal business operations   we may experience uninsured or underinsured losses which could result in a significant loss of the capital we have invested in a property decrease anticipated future revenues or cause us to incur unanticipated expense   we maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties with terms conditions limits and deductibles that we believe are adequate and appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage and we continually review the insurance maintained by us however a large number of our properties are located in areas exposed to earthquake windstorm flood and other natural disasters and may be subject to other losses in particular our life science portfolio is concentrated in areas known to be subject to earthquake activity while we purchase insurance for earthquake windstorm flood and other natural disasters that we believe is adequate in light of current industry practice and analysis prepared by outside consultants there is no assurance that such insurance will fully cover such losses these losses can decrease our anticipated revenues from a property and result in the loss of all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property the insurance market for such exposures can be very volatile and we may be unable to purchase the limits and terms we desire on a commercially reasonable basis in the future in addition there are certain exposures where insurance is not purchased as we do not believe it is economically feasible to do so or where there is no viable insurance market   environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with our real estate related investments may materially impair the value of those investments   under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations as a current or previous owner of real estate we may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum released at a property and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by the third parties in connection with the contamination in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and the costs it incurs in connection with the contamination although we i currently carry environmental insurance on our properties in an amount and subject to deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable and ii generally require our operators and tenants to undertake to indemnify us for environmental liabilities they cause such liabilities could exceed the amount of our insurance the financial ability of the tenant or operator to indemnify us or the value of the contaminated property the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may materially adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral as the owner of a site we may also be held liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the site although we are generally indemnified by the current operators or tenants of our properties for contamination caused by them these indemnities may not adequately cover all environmental costs we may also experience environmental liabilities arising from conditions not known to us   the impact of the comprehensive healthcare regulation enacted in 2010 on us and operators and tenants cannot accurately be predicted   legislative proposals are introduced or proposed in congress and in some state legislatures each year that would affect major changes in the healthcare system either nationally or at the state level  23      table of contents notably in march 2010 president obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act along with the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the affordable care act the passage of the affordable care act has resulted in comprehensive reform legislation that is expected to expand healthcare coverage to millions of currently uninsured people beginning in 2014 and provide for significant changes to the us healthcare system over the next ten years to help fund this expansion the affordable care act outlines certain reductions in medicare reimbursements for various healthcare providers including longterm acute care hospitals and skilled nursing facilities as well as certain other changes to medicare payment methodologies this comprehensive healthcare legislation provides for extensive future rulemaking by regulatory authorities and also may be altered or amended we cannot accurately predict whether any pending legislative proposals will be adopted or if adopted what effect if any these proposals would have on our operators and tenants and thus our business similarly while we can anticipate that some of the rulemaking that will be promulgated by regulatory authorities will affect our operators and tenants and the manner in which they are reimbursed by the federal healthcare programs we cannot accurately predict today the impact of those regulations on our operators and tenants and thus on our business   the supreme courts decision upholding the constitutionality of the individual mandate while striking down the provisions linking federal funding of state medicaid programs with a federally mandated expansion of those programs has not reduced the uncertain impact that the law will have on healthcare delivery systems over the next decade we can expect that the federal authorities will continue to implement the law but because of the courts mixed ruling the implementation will take longer than originally expected with a commensurate increase in the period of uncertainty regarding the laws full long term financial impact on the delivery of and payment for healthcare   risk related to tax including reitrelated risks   loss of our tax status as a reit would substantially reduce our available funds and would have material adverse consequences for us and the value of our common stock   qualification as a reit involves the application of numerous highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control we intend to continue to operate in a manner that enables us to qualify as a reit however our qualification and taxation as a reit depend upon our ability to meet through actual annual operating results asset diversification distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership the various qualification tests imposed under the code for example to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must make distributions to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains in addition new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could change the tax laws or interpretations of the tax laws regarding qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification in a manner that is materially adverse to our stockholders accordingly there is no assurance that we have operated or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a reit   if we lose our reit status we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to make payments of principal and interest on the debt securities we issue and to make distributions to stockholders if we fail to qualify as a reit   we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income   we will be subject to corporatelevel income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates   24      table of contents   we could be subject to increased state and local income taxes and  unless we are entitled to relief under relevant statutory provisions we will be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which we fail to qualify as a reit    as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock   we could have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities from corporate acquisitions that could limit delay or impede future sales of our properties   if during the tenyear period beginning on the date we acquire certain companies we recognize gain on the disposition of any property acquired then to the extent of the excess of i the fair market value of such property as of the acquisition date over ii our adjusted income tax basis in such property as of that date we will be required to pay a corporatelevel federal income tax on this gain at the highest regular corporate rate there can be no assurance that these triggering dispositions will not occur and these requirements could limit delay or impede future sales of our properties   in addition the irs may assert liabilities against us for corporate income taxes for taxable years prior to the time that we acquire certain companies in which case we will owe these taxes plus interest and penalties if any   there are uncertainties relating to the calculation of nonreit tax earnings and profits eampp in certain acquisitions which may require us to distribute eampp   in order to remain qualified as a reit we are required to distribute to our stockholders all of the accumulated nonreit eampp of certain companies that we acquire prior to the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs failure to make such eampp distributions would result in our disqualification as a reit the determination of the amount to be distributed in such eampp distributions is a complex factual and legal determination we may have less than complete information at the time we undertake our analysis or we may interpret the applicable law differently from the irs we currently believe that we have satisfied the requirements relating to such eampp distributions there are however substantial uncertainties relating to the determination of eampp including the possibility that the irs could successfully assert that the taxable income of the companies acquired should be increased which would increase our nonreit eampp moreover an audit of the acquired company following our acquisition could result in an increase in accumulated nonreit eampp which could require us to pay an additional taxable distribution to our thenexisting stockholders if we qualify under rules for curing this type of default or could result in our disqualification as a reit   thus we might fail to satisfy the requirement that we distribute all of our nonreit eampp by the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs moreover although there are procedures available to cure a failure to distribute all of our eampp we cannot now determine whether we will be able to take advantage of these procedures or the economic impact on us of doing so   our charter contains ownership limits with respect to our common stock and other classes of capital stock   our charter contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our common stock and preferred stock that are intended to assist us in preserving our qualification as a reit under our charter subject to certain exceptions no person or entity may own actually or constructively more than 98 by value or by number of

limitation on the direct or indirect ownership of our voting shares which may include common stock or other classes of capital stock our board of directors in its sole discretion may exempt a proposed transferee from either ownership limit the ownership limits may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders   we are subject to certain provisions of maryland law and our charter relating to business combinations   the maryland business combination act provides that unless exempted a maryland corporation may not engage in business combinations including a merger consolidation share exchange or in circumstances specified in the statute an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities with an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interested

the voting power of the outstanding voting stock of a maryland corporation unless our board of directors takes action to exempt us generally or with respect to certain transactions from this statute in the future the maryland business combination act will be applicable to business combinations between us and other persons   in addition to the restrictions on business combinations contained in the maryland business combination act our charter also contains restrictions on business combinations our charter requires that except in certain circumstances business combinations including a merger or consolidation and certain asset transfers and issuances of securities with a related person including a beneficial owner of 10 or more of our outstanding voting stock be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 90 of our outstanding voting stock   the restrictions on business combinations provided under maryland law and contained in our charter may delay defer or prevent a change of control or other transaction even if such transaction involves a premium price for our common stock or our stockholders believe that such transaction is otherwise in their best interests
