2013 the balance at december 28 2014 includes a decrease of approximately 9900 resulting from the translation of foreign currencies absent translation the decrease primarily relates to the partial sale of the companys investment in the network and to a lesser extent lower longterm prepaid royalties which have been reclassified from noncurrent to current or have been earned these decreases were partially offset by higher favorable balances related to foreign currency hedging contracts and higher deferred income taxes relating to higher pension liabilities and the partial sale of the companys investment in the network other assets increased to 715227 at december 29 2013 from 695187 at december 30 2012 the increase in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily reflects higher longterm prepaid

the translation of foreign currency the increase in 2014 compared to 2013 reflects higher pension liabilities primarily due to changes in actuarial assumptions including a lower discount rate and updated mortality tables in addition the amended relationship between the company and discovery resulted in a net increase to other liabilities of approximately 10700 reflecting the fair value of an option agreement related to the companys equity interest in the network partially offset by a reduction in the amounts due to discovery related to a tax sharing agreement these increases were partially offset by lower liabilities related to uncertain tax positions reflecting the settlement of tax examinations in 2014 primarily related to the united states and mexico in connection with the settlement of tax assessments and years subject to audit from 2000 through 2013 in mexico the company paid approximately 65000 during the fourth quarter of 2014 other liabilities of 352304 at december 29 2013 decreased from 461152 at december 30 2012 the decrease in 2013 compared to 2012 is primarily due to lower liabilities related to pension and uncertain tax positions the decline in liabilities related to uncertain tax positions is primarily due to the settlement of tax examinations during 2013 partially offset by additions for current year activity the decline in pension liabilities is primarily due to increased discount rates and to a lesser extent increased benefit payments due to a higher level of retirements during 2013 resulting from an early retirement program in the united states relating to the cost savings initiative  cash flows utilized by investing activities were 485 217743 and 106172 in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively additions to property plant and equipment were

105258 102799 and 99718 respectively fluctuations in depreciation of plant and equipment correlate with the percentage of additions to property plant and equipment relating to tools dies and molds which have shorter useful lives and accelerated depreciation the 2014 utilization is almost wholly offset by 64400 of cash received from discovery from the partial sale of the companys equity interest in the network and 36000 of cash received from the sale of certain intellectual property licensing rights which was included in other investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows the higher utilization in 2013 reflects the companys acquisition of a majority stake in backflip for 109955 net of cash acquired as well as a payment related to an existing intellectual property no investments or acquisitions were made in 2012  the company commits to inventory production advertising and marketing expenditures prior to the peak fourth quarter retail selling season accounts receivable increase during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in their holiday selling season due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year this timing difference between expenditures and cash collections on accounts receivable makes it necessary for the company to borrow higher amounts during the latter part of the year during 2014 2013 and 2012 the company primarily used cash from operations and borrowings under its commercial paper program and available lines of credit  the company has an agreement with a group of banks which provides for a commercial paper program the

dividends paid in 2012 include an additional dividend payment resulting from a decision by the companys board to accelerate the payment of the dividend declared in december 2012 which historically would have been paid in february 2013 to december 2012 this acceleration resulted in one less quarterly dividend paid in 2013 further the company has increased its quarterly dividend rate from 036 in 2012 to 040 in 2013 and 043 in 2014 lastly proceeds from other shortterm borrowings of 246054 and 43016 in 2014 and 2012 respectively compared to repayments of other shortterm borrowings of 215273 in

to guaranteed royalty and other contractual payments of approximately 107238 in 2015  critical accounting policies and significant estimates  the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america as such management is required to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on information available these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial    46    table of contents  statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented the significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the companys reported financial results include sales allowances program production costs recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets recoverability of royalty advances and commitments pension costs and obligations and income taxes  sales allowances  sales allowances for customer promotions discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue when the related revenue is recognized revenue from product sales is recognized upon passing of title to the customer generally at the time of shipment revenue from product sales less related sales allowances along with license fees and royalty revenue comprise net revenues in the consolidated statements of operations the company routinely commits to promotional sales allowance programs with customers these allowances primarily relate to fixed programs which the customer earns based on purchases of company products during the year discounts and allowances are recorded as a reduction of related revenue at the time of sale while many of the allowances are based on fixed amounts certain of the allowances such as the returns allowance are based on market data historical trends and information from customers and are therefore subject to estimation  for its allowance programs that are not fixed such as returns the company estimates these amounts using a combination of historical experience and current market conditions these estimates are reviewed periodically against actual results and any adjustments are recorded at that time as an increase or decrease to net revenues during 2014 there have been no material adjustments to the companys estimates made in prior years  program production costs  the company incurs certain costs in connection with the production of television programs based primarily on the companys toy and game brands including animated and liveaction programs and game shows these costs are capitalized as they are incurred and amortized using the individualfilmforecast method whereby these costs are amortized in the proportion that the current years revenues bear to managements estimate of total ultimate revenues as of the beginning of each fiscal year related to the program these capitalized costs are reported at the lower of cost less accumulated amortization or fair value and reviewed for impairment when an event or change in circumstances occurs that indicates that an impairment may exist the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model which is primarily based on managements future revenue and cost estimates  the most significant estimates are those used in the determination of ultimate revenue in the individualfilmforecast method ultimate revenue estimates impact the timing of program production cost amortization in the consolidated statements of operations ultimate revenue includes revenue from all sources that are estimated to be earned related to the television program and include toy game and other merchandise licensing fees first run program distribution fees and other revenue sources such as dvd and digital distribution our ultimate revenue estimates for each television program are developed based on our estimates of expected future results we review and revise these estimates at each reporting date to reflect the most current available information when estimates for a television program are revised the difference between the program production cost amortization determined using the revised estimate and any amounts previously expensed during that fiscal year are included as an adjustment to program production cost amortization in the consolidated statements of operations in the quarter in which the estimates are revised prior period amounts are not adjusted for subsequent changes in estimates factors that can impact our revenue estimates include the success and popularity of our television programs in the us which are distributed on discovery family channel globally to other broadcasters and available on netflix and itunes and success of our programrelated toy game and other merchandise  for the year ended december 28 2014 we have 68190 of program production costs included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets we currently expect that substantially all capitalized program production costs will be amortized over the 3year period 2015 through 2017 future program production cost    47    table of contents  amortization is subject to change based on actual costs incurred and managements then current estimates of ultimate revenues during 2014 and 2013 the company recorded accelerated amortization on certain television programming based on revised ultimate expected revenues  recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets  goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the company will perform an interim test at that time the company may perform a qualitative assessment and bypass the quantitative twostep impairment process if it is not more likely than not that impairment exists  performing a qualitative assessment of goodwill requires a high degree of judgment regarding assumptions underlying the valuation qualitative factors and their impact on critical inputs are assessed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value if it is more likely than not that impairment exists the quantitative twostep goodwill impairment test is performed when performing the quantitative twostep impairment test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value which is calculated using an income approach if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of that reporting unit an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value during the fourth quarter of 2014 the company performed a qualitative assessment with respect to certain of its reporting units with goodwill totaling 474327 the company utilized this approach for all reporting units with the exception of backflip based on the amount by which historical estimated reporting unit fair values exceeded carrying values based on its qualitative assessment the company concluded that there was no impairment of this goodwill during 2014 the company has 119111 of goodwill related to its 2013 acquisition of backflip which represents a separate reporting unit because backflip was a recent acquisition the company performed the quantitative twostep impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2014 for this reporting unit and concluded that there was no impairment as the estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value backflips impairment test utilized cash flows expected to be generated from mobile gaming offerings including releases based on existing backflip and hasbro game titles as well as a discount rate commensurate with the emerging digital landscape the underlying cash flows are based on longterm financial plans for backflip which include projections for growth in revenues and profitability should backflip not achieve its profitability and growth targets the carrying value of this reporting unit may become impaired  the company also performed quantitative twostep annual impairment tests related to intangible assets totaling 75738 with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of 2014 and no impairments were indicated as the estimated fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying values of the related assets  the estimation of future cash flows utilized in the evaluation of the companys goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge  intangible assets other than those with indefinite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable recoverability of the value of these intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if such assets were considered to be impaired the impairment would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated future discounted cash flows the estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment    48    table of contents  and result in an impairment charge the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge intangible assets covered under this policy were 248790 at december 28 2014 during 2014 there were no impairment charges related to these intangible assets  recoverability of royalty advances and commitments  the companys ability to earnout royalty advances and contractual obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the estimated future sales forecasts and related cash flow projections to be derived from the related product if sales forecasts and related cash flows from the particular product do not support the recoverability of the remaining minimum guaranty or if the company decides to discontinue a product line with royalty advances or commitments a charge to royalty expense to writeoff the nonrecoverable minimum guaranty is required the preparation of revenue forecasts and related cash flows for these products requires judgments and estimates actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in the assessment of anticipated revenues and cash flows related to these products could result in a change to the assessment of recoverability of remaining minimum guaranteed royalties at december 28 2014 the company had 230840 of prepaid royalties 132146 of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and 98694 of which are included in other assets during 2014 there were no significant charges related to this policy  pension costs and obligations  pension expense is based on actuarial computations of current and future benefits using estimates for expected return on assets and applicable discount rates at the end of 2007 the company froze benefits under its two largest pension plans in the us with no future benefits accruing to employees the company will continue to pay benefits under the plan consistent with the provisions existing at the date of the plan benefit freeze the company uses its fiscal yearend date as its measurement date to measure the liabilities and assets of the plans and to establish the expense for the upcoming year  the company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted average rate based on historical market data for the investment classes of assets held by the plan the allocation of plan assets among those investment classes and the current economic environment based on this information the companys estimate of expected return on plan assets used in the calculation of 2014 pension expense for the us plans was 700 a decrease in the estimate used for expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense while an increase in this estimate would decrease pension expense a decrease of 025 in the estimate of expected return on plan assets would have increased 2014 pension expense for us plans by approximately 660  discount rates are selected based upon rates of return at the measurement date on high quality corporate bond investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits the companys weighted average discount rate for its us plans used for the calculation of 2014 pension expense was 502 a decrease in the discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense a decrease of 025 in the companys discount rate would have increased 2014 pension expense by approximately 460  actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and if outside a certain corridor amortized over future periods and therefore affect recognized expense in future periods at december 28 2014 the companys us plans had unrecognized actuarial losses of 123968 included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings related to its defined benefit pension plans compared to 69716 at december 28 2013 the increase primarily reflects unrecognized actuarial losses in 2014 compared to gains in 2013 due to a decrease in the discount rate used to measure plan obligations at december 28 2014 as well as utilization of updated mortality tables which reflect increased life expectancy the discount rate used to calculate the projected benefit obligation at december 28 2014 decreased to 419 from 502 used at december 29 2013 a decrease of 025 in the companys discount rate would have increased the 2014 projected benefit obligation by    49    table of contents  approximately 12175 pension plan assets are valued on the basis of their fair market value on the measurement date these changes in the fair market value of plan assets impact the amount of future pension expense due to amortization of the unrecognized actuarial losses or gains  income taxes  the companys annual income tax rate is based on its income statutory tax rates changes in prior tax positions and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates significant judgment and estimates are required to determine the companys annual tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions despite the companys belief that its tax return positions are fully supportable these positions are subject to challenge and estimated liabilities are established in the event that these positions are challenged and the company is not successful in defending these challenges these estimated liabilities are adjusted as well as the related interest in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit  an estimated effective income tax rate is applied to the companys interim results in the event there is a significant unusual or extraordinary item recognized in the companys interim results the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the time in addition changes in judgment regarding likely outcomes related to tax positions taken in a prior fiscal year or tax costs or benefits from a resolution of such positions would be recorded entirely in the interim period the judgment changes or resolution occurs during 2014 and 2013 the company recorded a net benefit of approximately 20000 and 30000 respectively associated with discrete tax events primarily related to the completion of us and mexico tax examinations as well as certain other us and foreign prior period tax adjustments during 2014 the company paid approximately 65000 to settle tax assessments and years subject to audit from 2000 through 2013 in mexico the company incurred additional tax expense in 2014 of 6910 related to this settlement  in certain cases tax law requires items to be included in the companys income tax returns at a different time than when these items are recognized on the consolidated financial statements or at a different amount than that which is recognized on the consolidated financial statements some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible on the companys tax returns while other differences are temporary and will reverse over time such as depreciation expense these differences that will reverse over time are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets deferred tax assets represent deductions that have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements but have not yet been reflected in the companys income tax returns valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets to the extent that it is determined that the company will have insufficient future taxable income including capital gains to fully realize the future deductions or capital losses deferred tax liabilities represent expenses recognized on the companys income tax return that have not yet been recognized in the companys consolidated financial statements or income recognized in the consolidated financial statements that has not yet been recognized in the companys income tax return deferred income taxes have not been provided on most of the undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries as most of such earnings are indefinitely reinvested by the company in the event the company determines that such earnings will not be indefinitely reinvested it would be required to accrue for any additional income taxes representing the difference between the tax rates in the united states and the applicable tax of the international subsidiaries at december 28 2014 the difference between the tax rates in the united states and the applicable tax of the international subsidiaries on cumulative undistributed earnings was approximately 513000    50    table of contents contractual obligations and commercial commitments  in the normal course of its business the company enters into

commercial paper program or lines of credit will allow the company to meet these and other obligations described above  financial risk management  the company is exposed to market risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as the result of sourcing products priced in us dollars hong kong dollars and euros while marketing those products in more than twenty currencies results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the us dollar hong kong dollar euro british pound sterling canadian dollar brazilian real russian ruble and mexican peso and to a lesser extent other currencies in latin american and asia pacific countries  to manage this exposure the company has hedged a portion of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using foreign exchange forward contracts the company estimates that a hypothetical immediate 10 depreciation of the us dollar against all foreign currencies included in these foreign exchange forward contracts could result in an approximate 74700 decrease in the fair value of these instruments a decrease in the fair value of these instruments would be substantially offset by decreases in the value of the forecasted foreign currency transactions  the company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or shortterm borrowing positions in currencies other than the us dollar the company believes however that the ongoing risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition in addition the companys revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates a significant change in foreign exchange rates can materially impact the companys revenues and earnings due to translation of foreigndenominated revenues and expenses the company does not hedge against translation impacts of foreign exchange from time to time affiliates of the company may make or receive intercompany loans in currencies other than their functional currency the company manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using foreign exchange contracts  the company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets the company does not speculate in foreign currency exchange contracts at december 28 2014 these contracts had net unrealized gains of 65937 of which 35086 are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets 34062 are recorded in other assets and 2591 are recorded in accrued liabilities included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings at december 28 2014 are deferred gains of 64200 net of tax related to these derivatives  at december 28 2014 the company had fixed rate longterm debt of 1559895 of this longterm debt 600000 represents the aggregate issuance of longterm debt in may 2014 which consists of 300000 of 315 notes due 2021 and 300000 of 510 notes due 2044 during the fourth quarter of 2013 and first quarter of 2014 the company entered into forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements with a total notional value of 500000 to hedge the anticipated underlying us treasury interest rate associated with the may 2014 debt issuance these interest rate swaps were matched with this debt issuance and were designated and effective as hedges of the change in future interest payments at the date of issuance the company terminated these swap agreements and their fair value at the date of issuance 33306 was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and is being amortized through the consolidated statements of operations using an effective interest rate method over the life of the related debt included in accumulated other comprehensive loss at december 28 2014 are deferred losses net of tax of 20511 related to these derivatives  the economy and inflation  the principal market for the companys products is the retail sector revenues from the companys top five customers all retailers accounted for approximately 38 of its consolidated net revenues in 2014 and 39 and 42 of its consolidated net revenues in 2013 and 2012 respectively the company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate    52    table of contents the companys revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year to be more significant to its overall business for the full year in 2014 approximately 65 of the companys full year net revenues were recognized in the second half of the year the company expects that this concentration will continue the concentration of sales in the second half of the year increases the risk of a underproduction of popular items b overproduction of less popular items and c failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules the business of the company is characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line product availability marketing strategies inventory levels policies of retailers and differences in overall economic conditions larger retailers generally maintain lower inventories throughout the year and purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer buying season which includes christmas  quick response inventory management practices being used by retailers result in more orders being placed for immediate delivery and fewer orders being placed well in advance of shipment retailers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers closer to the time of purchase by consumers to the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their yearend inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed thus negatively impacting the companys future revenues in addition the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the companys significant retailers could negatively impact the companys future revenues  the effect of inflation on the companys operations during 2014 was not significant and the company will continue its practice of monitoring costs and adjusting prices accordingly  other information  the company is not aware of any material amounts of potential exposure relating to environmental matters and does not believe its environmental compliance costs or liabilities to be material to its operating results or financial position
