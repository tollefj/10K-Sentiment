 our business is subject to a variety of risks our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted by the following risk factors these risks are not the only risks that may impact our business if overall demand for products sold by our stores slows or declines our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows will suffer decreased demand could also negatively impact our stock price overall demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may slow or decrease due to any number of reasons including the number and average age of vehicles being driven because fewer vehicles means less maintenance and repairs and vehicles that are seven years old and older are generally no longer covered under manufacturers warranties and tend to need more maintenance and repair than newer vehicles if the number andor average age of vehicles being driven were to decrease it would negatively impact demand for our productsthe economy because during periods of declining economic conditions both commercial and diy customers may defer vehicle maintenance or repair conversely during periods of favorable economic conditions more of our diy customers may pay others to repair and maintain their cars or they may purchase new carsthe weather because milder weather conditions may lower the failure rates of automobile parts while extended periods of rain and winter precipitation may cause our customers to defer elective maintenance and repair of their vehicles the average duration of manufacturer warranties and the decrease in the number of annual miles driven because newer cars typically require fewer repairs and will be repaired by the manufacturers dealer network using dealer parts pursuant to warranties which have gradually increased in duration andor mileage expiration over the recent past and lower vehicle mileage which may be affected by gas prices and other factors decreases the need for maintenance and repair while higher miles driven increases the need technological advances and the increase in quality of vehicles manufactured because vehicles that need less frequent maintenance and have low part failure rates will require less frequent repairs using aftermarket parts andthe refusal of vehicle manufacturers to make available diagnostic repair and maintenance information to the automotive aftermarket industry that our commercial and diy customers require to diagnose repair and maintain their vehicles because this may force consumers to have a majority of diagnostic work repairs and maintenance performed by the vehicle manufacturers dealer networkif we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the automotive aftermarket industry we may lose customers our revenues may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many ways including name recognition location price quality product availability and customer service we compete in both the commercial and diy categories of the automotive aftermarket industry primarily with i national and regional chains of automotive parts stores ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products iii wholesalers or jobbers stores including those associated with national parts distributors or associations iv independentlyowned stores v automobile dealers that supply parts and vi internetbased retailers these competitors and the level of competition vary by market some of our competitors may possess advantages over us in certain markets we share including a greater amount of marketing activities a larger number of stores more desirable store locations better store layouts longer operating histories greater name recognition larger and more established customer bases more favorable vendor relationships lower prices and better product warranties consolidation among our competitors could enhance their market share and financial position provide them with the ability to achieve better purchasing terms and allow them to provide more competitive prices to customers for whom we compete in addition our reputation is critical to our continued success if we fail to maintain high standards for or receive negative publicity whether through social media or normal media channels relating to product safety quality or integrity we could lose customers to our competition the product we sell is branded both in brands of our vendors and in our own private label brands if the perceived quality or value of the brands we sell declines in the eyes of our customers our results of operations could be negatively affectedthese competitive disadvantages may require us to reduce our prices below our normal selling prices or increase our promotional spending which would lower our revenue and profitability competitive disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product lines require us to discontinue current product offerings or change some of our current operating strategies if we do not have the resources expertise consistent execution or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies to  10table of contentsaddress these competitive disadvantages we may lose customers our revenues and profit margins may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable we may not be able to successfully integrate gpis operations with ours the gpi business may not achieve the expected business results and could cause us to incur unexpected liabilities the gpi acquisition has caused and may continue to cause us to incur significant integration costs and our level of indebtedness could limit the cash flow available for operations and could adversely affect our ability to service our debt or obtain additional financingintegration issues and business expectationswe cannot be certain whether and to what extent any strategic operational financial or other anticipated benefits resulting from the acquisition of gpi will be achieved in order to obtain the anticipated benefits of the transaction we must integrate gpis operations with ours this integration is complex and our failure to integrate quickly and effectively may negatively affect our earnings the market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the acquisition if our integration of gpi is unsuccessful takes longer than expected or fails to achieve financial benefits to the extent anticipated by financial analysts or investors or the effect of the acquisition on our financial results is otherwise not consistent with the expectations of financial analysts or investorsthe acquisition of gpi could cause disruptions in and create uncertainty surrounding our business including affecting our relationships with existing and future customers wholesalers independentlyowned and jobber stores suppliers and team members which could have an adverse effect on our business financial results and operations in particular we could lose customers or suppliers and new customer or supplier contracts could be delayed or decreased or otherwise adversely affected in economic value in addition we have diverted and will continue to divert significant management resources towards the integration efforts which could adversely affect our business and results of operationsin connection with our acquisition of gpi we assumed all of the liabilities of gpi including any actual or contingent liabilities to which gpi is or may become subject gpi may be or may become subject to loss contingencies known or unknown which could relate to past present or future facts events circumstances or occurrences although the agreement pursuant to which we acquired gpi provides us with certain indemnification provisions potential costs relating to any such liabilities could exceed the amount of any such indemnification or extend beyond the indemnification periodadditional integration costsin connection with the gpi acquisition we have incurred significant transaction costs and entered into new financing agreements and issued new debt instruments we expect to incur additional integration costs in connection with the acquisition although efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses may allow us to offset incremental integration costs over time this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all level of indebtednessin connection with our acquisition of gpi our level of indebtedness increased significantly our indebtedness could restrict our operations and make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations for example our level of indebtedness could among other thingsaffect our liquidity by limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital limit our ability to obtain financing for capital expenditures and acquisitions or make any available financing more costlyrequire us to dedicate all or a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our debt which would reduce funds available for other business purposes such as capital expenditures dividends or acquisitionslimit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in the markets in which we competeplace us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors who may have less indebtednessrender us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions andmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations including those relating to the notes associated with the acquisition of gpiin addition the indenture governing the notes related to the gpi acquisition and the credit agreement governing the new credit facilities contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our  11table of contentslongterm best interests our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt including such noteswe may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy including increasing comparable store sales enhancing our margins and increasing our return on invested capital which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity we have implemented numerous initiatives as part of our business strategy to increase comparable store sales and enhance our margins in order to increase our earnings and cash flow if we are unable to implement these initiatives efficiently and effectively or if these initiatives are unsuccessful our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected successful implementation of our business strategy also depends on factors specific to the automotive aftermarket industry and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control in addition to the aforementioned risk factors adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our business strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows the competitive environment in the automotive aftermarket retail sector that may force us to reduce prices below our desired pricing level or increase promotional spending our ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and to meet customers needs for automotive products particularly parts availability in a timely manner our ability to maintain and eventually grow diy market share andour ability to continue our commercial sales growthfor that portion of our inventory manufactured andor sourced outside the united states geopolitical changes changes in trade regulations currency fluctuations shipping related issues natural disasters pandemics and other factors beyond our control may increase the cost of items we purchase or create shortages which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability we will not be able to expand our business if our growth strategy including the availability of suitable locations for new store openings and the continued increase in supply chain capacity and efficiency is not successful which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows new store openings we have increased our store count significantly in the last ten years from 2872 stores at the end of our 2005 fiscal year to 5293 stores as of january 2 2016 we intend to continue to increase the number of our stores and expand the markets we serve as part of our growth strategy primarily by opening new stores we may also grow our business through strategic acquisitions we do not know whether the implementation of our growth strategy will be successful as we open more stores it becomes more critical that we have consistent execution across our entire store chain the actual number of new stores to be opened and their success will depend on a number of factors including among other thingsthe availability of desirable store locations the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locationsthe availability of financial resources including access to capital at costeffective interest rates andour ability to manage the expansion and to hire train and retain qualified team memberswe are unsure whether we will be able to open and operate new stores on a timely or sufficiently profitable basis or that opening new stores in markets we already serve will not harm existing store profitability or comparable store sales the newly opened and existing stores profitability will depend on the competition we face as well as our ability to properly merchandise market and price the products desired by customers in these markets supply chainour store inventories are primarily replenished by shipments from our network of distribution centers warehouses and hub stores as we service our growing store base we will need to increase the capacity of our supply chain network in order to provide the added parts availability under our superior availability strategy while maintaining productivity and profitability expectations we cannot be assured of the availability of potential locations on lease or purchase terms that would be acceptable  12table of contentsto us of our ability to integrate those new locations into our existing supply chain network or of our ability to increase the productivity and efficiency of our overall supply chain network to desired levels we are dependent on our suppliers to supply us with products that comply with safety and quality standards at competitive priceswe are dependent on our vendors continuing to supply us quality products on terms that are favorable to us if our merchandise offerings do not meet our customers expectations regarding safety and quality we could experience lost sales increased costs and exposure to legal and reputational risk all of our suppliers must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety and quality standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action andor private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities to the extent our suppliers are subject to additional government regulation of their product design andor manufacturing processes the cost of the merchandise we purchase may rise in addition negative customer perceptions regarding the safety or quality of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our customerswe depend on the services of many qualified executives and other team members whom we may not be able to attract develop and retain our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience of our executives and other team members as of february 26 2016 we employed approximately 73000 team members we may not be able to retain our current qualified executive and other team members or attract and retain additional qualified executives and team members who may be needed in the future our ability to maintain an adequate number of qualified executive and other team members is highly dependent on an attractive and competitive compensation and benefits package in addition less than one percent of our team members are represented by unions if these team members were to engage in a strike work stoppage or other slowdown or if the terms and conditions in labor agreements were renegotiated we could experience a disruption in our operations and higher ongoing labor costs if we fail or are unable to maintain competitive compensation our customer service and execution levels could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows there is also a risk that we may experience difficulty in successfully implementing announced leadership changes including a failure to ensure the effective transfer of knowledge necessary for the persons appointed to lead and provide results in their new role potential disruption to our business resulting from the announced changes and the impact of announced leadership changes on our relationships with customers suppliers and business partners the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigationthe stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline the market price of our stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts expectations failure to meet such expectations even slightly could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such a company if similar litigation were instituted against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our businessdeterioration in global credit markets and changes in our credit ratings and deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions including unemployment inflation or deflation consumer debt levels high fuel and energy costs and higher tax rates could have a negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions impacts us through i potential adverse effects from deteriorating and uncertain credit markets ii the negative impact on our suppliers and customers and iii an increase in operating costs from higher energy pricesimpact of credit market uncertainty and changes in credit ratingssignificant deterioration in the financial condition of large financial institutions in 2008 and 2009 resulted in a severe loss of liquidity and available credit in global credit markets and in more stringent borrowing terms we can provide no assurance that the credit market events during 2008 and 2009 will not occur again in the foreseeable future conditions and events in the  13table of contentsglobal credit market could have a material adverse effect on our access to short and longterm borrowings to finance our operations and the terms and cost of that debt it is possible that one or more of the banks that provide us with financing under our revolving credit facility may fail to honor the terms of our existing credit facility or be financially unable to provide the unused credit our overall credit rating may be negatively impacted by deteriorating and uncertain credit markets or other factors which may or may not be within our control the interest rates on our publicly issued debt term loan and revolving credit facility are linked directly to our credit ratings accordingly any negative impact on our credit rating would likely result in higher interest rates and interest expense on any borrowings under our revolving credit facility term loan or future issuances of public debt and less favorable terms on other operating and financing arrangements in addition it could reduce the attractiveness of our vendor payment programs where certain of our vendors finance payment obligations from us with designated third party financial institutions which could result in increased working capital requirements an inability to obtain sufficient financing at costeffective rates could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows impact on our suppliersour business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers ability and willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms many factors outside our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms such factors include a general decline in the economy and economic conditions and prolonged recessionary conditions these events could negatively affect our suppliers operations and make it difficult for them to obtain the credit lines or loans necessary to finance their operations in the shortterm or longterm and meet our product requirements financial or operational difficulties that some of our suppliers may face could also increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them we might not be able to pass our increased costs onto our customers if our suppliers fail to develop new products we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and our results of operations could be negatively affectedin addition the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the offshoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience bankruptcies work stoppages labor strikes or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them impact on our customersdeterioration in macroeconomic conditions may have a negative impact on our customers net worth financial resources and disposable income this impact could reduce our customers willingness or ability to pay for accessories maintenance or repair of their vehicles which results in lower sales in our stores an increase in fuel costs may also reduce the overall number of miles driven by our customers resulting in fewer parts failures and a reduced need for elective maintenance impact on operating costsrising energy prices could directly impact our operating and product costs including our merchandise distribution commercial delivery utility and product acquisition costsbecause we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees and other costs we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation which may include class action litigation from customers team members or others for various actions from time to time we are involved in litigation involving claims related to among other things breach of contract tortious conduct employment labor discrimination including the americans with disabilities act payment of wages asbestos exposure real estate regulatory compliance and product defects the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to among other things environmental protection product quality standards building and zoning requirements discrimination including the americans with disabilities act
