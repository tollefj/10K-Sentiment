 our business is subject to a variety of risks both known and unknown our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted by the following risk factors these risks are not the only risks that may impact our business if overall demand for products sold by our stores slows or declines our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows will suffer decreased demand could also negatively impact our stock price overall demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may slow or decrease due to any number of reasons including the number and average age of vehicles being driven because the majority of vehicles that are seven years old and older are generally no longer covered under the manufacturers warranties and tend to need maintenance and repair if the number and average age of vehicles being driven were to decrease it would negatively impact demand for our products8table of contentsthe economy because during periods of declining economic conditions both diy and commercial customers may defer vehicle maintenance or repair conversely during periods of favorable economic conditions more of our diy customers may pay others to repair and maintain their cars or they may purchase new carsthe weather because milder weather conditions may lower the failure rates of automobile parts while extended periods of rain and winter precipitation may cause our customers to defer elective maintenance and repair of their vehicles the average duration of manufacturer warranties and the decrease in the number of annual miles driven because newer cars typically require fewer repairs and will be repaired by the manufacturers dealer network using dealer parts and lower vehicle mileage which may be affected by gas prices and other factors decreases the need for maintenance and repair while higher miles driven increases the need technological advances and the increase in quality of vehicles manufactured because vehicles that need less frequent maintenance and have low part failure rates will require less frequent repairs using aftermarket parts our vendors because if any of our key vendors do not supply us with products on terms that are favorable to us or fail to develop new products we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and our results of operations could be negatively affected our reputation and our brands because our reputation is critical to our continued success if we fail to maintain high standards for or receive negative publicity whether through social media or normal media channels relating to product safety quality or integrity it could reduce demand for our products the product we sell is branded both in brands of our vendors and in our own private label brands if the perceived quality or value of the brands we sell declines in the eyes of our customers our results of operations could be negatively affected andthe refusal of vehicle manufacturers to make available diagnostic repair and maintenance information to the automotive aftermarket industry that our diy and commercial customers require to diagnose repair and maintain their vehicles because this may force consumers to have a majority of diagnostic work repairs and maintenance performed by the vehicle manufacturers dealer networkif any of these factors cause overall demand for the products we sell to decline our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted if we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the automotive aftermarket industry we may lose customers our revenues may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many ways including name recognition location price quality product availability and customer service we compete in both the diy and commercial categories of the automotive aftermarket industry primarily with i national and regional retail automotive parts chains ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products iii wholesalers or jobber stores iv independent operators v automobile dealers that supply parts and vi internetbased parts providers these competitors and the level of competition vary by market some of our competitors may possess advantages over us in certain markets we share including a greater amount of marketing activities a larger number of stores store locations store layouts longer operating histories greater name recognition larger and more established customer bases more favorable vendor relationships lower prices and better product warranties our response to these competitive disadvantages may require us to reduce our prices below our normal selling prices or increase our promotional spending which would lower our revenue and profitability competitive disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product lines require us to discontinue current product offerings or change some of our current operating strategies if we do not have the resources expertise consistent execution or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies to address these competitive disadvantages we may lose customers our revenues and profit margins may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy including increasing comparable store sales enhancing our margins and increasing our return on invested capital which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity we have implemented numerous initiatives as part of our business strategy to increase comparable store sales enhance our margins and increase our return on invested capital in order to increase our earnings and cash flow if we are unable to implement these initiatives efficiently and effectively or if these initiatives are unsuccessful our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected 9table of contentssuccessful implementation of our business strategy also depends on factors specific to the retail automotive parts industry and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control in addition to the aforementioned risk factors adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our business strategy and have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow the competitive environment in the automotive aftermarket parts and accessories retail sector that may force us to reduce prices below our desired pricing level or increase promotional spending our ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and to meet customers needs for automotive products particularly parts availability in a timely manner our ability to maintain and eventually grow diy market share andour ability to continue our commercial sales growthfor that portion of our inventory manufactured andor sourced outside the united states geopolitical changes changes in trade regulations currency fluctuations shipping related issues natural disasters pandemics and other factors beyond our control may increase the cost of items we purchase or create shortages which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability we will not be able to expand our business if our growth strategy is not successful including the availability of suitable locations for new store openings the successful integration of any acquired businesses or the continued increase in supply chain capacity and efficiency which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows new store openings we have increased our store count significantly in the last ten years from 2435 stores at the end of fiscal 2002 to 3794 stores at december 29 2012 we intend to continue to increase the number of our stores and expand the markets we serve as part of our growth strategy primarily by opening new stores we may also grow our business through strategic acquisitions we do not know whether the implementation of our growth strategy will be successful as we open more stores it becomes more critical that we have consistent execution across our entire store chain the actual number of new stores to be opened and their success will depend on a number of factors including among other thingsthe availability of desirable store locations the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locationsthe availability of financial resources including access to capital at costeffective interest rates andour ability to manage the expansion and hire train and retain qualified sales associateswe are unsure whether we will be able to open and operate new stores on a timely or sufficiently profitable basis or that opening new stores in markets we already serve will not harm existing store profitability or comparable store sales the newly opened and existing stores profitability will depend on the competition we face as well as our ability to properly merchandise market and price the products desired by customers in these markets acquisition integrationon december 31 2012 we acquired bwp distributors inc strategic acquisitions have been and may continue to be an element of our growth strategy in the future acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth and profitability to differ from our expectations examples of such risks include the followingwe may not be able to continue to identify suitable acquisition targets or to acquire additional companies at favorable prices or on other favorable termsour managements attention may be distractedwe may fail to retain key personnel from acquired businesseswe may assume unanticipated legal liabilities and other problemswe may not be able to successfully integrate the operations of businesses we acquire to realize economic operational and other benefits andwe may fail or be unable to discover liabilities of businesses that we acquire for which we as a successor owner or operator may be liable10table of contentssupply chainour store inventories are primarily replenished by shipments from our network of distribution centers pdq warehouses and hub stores as we service our growing store base we will need to increase the capacity of our supply chain network in order to provide the added parts availability under our superior availability strategy while maintaining productivity and profitability expectations we cannot be assured of the availability of potential locations on lease or purchase terms that would be acceptable to us of our ability to integrate those new locations into our existing supply chain network or of our ability to increase the productivity and efficiency of our overall supply chain network to desired levels we are dependent on our suppliers to supply us with products that comply with safety and quality standardsif our merchandise offerings do not meet our customers expectations regarding safety and quality we could experience lost sales increased costs and exposure to legal and reputational risk all of our suppliers must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety and quality standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities to the extent our suppliers are subject to added government regulation of their product design andor manufacturing processes the cost of the merchandise we purchase may rise in addition negative customer perceptions regarding the safety or quality of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our customerswe depend on the services of many qualified team members whom we may not be able to attract and retain our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience of our team members at february 22 2013 we employed approximately 55000 team members we may not be able to retain our current qualified team members or attract and retain additional qualified team members that may be needed in the future our ability to maintain an adequate number of qualified team members is highly dependent on an attractive and competitive compensation and benefits package if we fail or are unable to maintain such a package our customer service and execution levels could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigationthe stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies if similar litigation were instituted against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our businessdeterioration in global credit markets and changes in our credit ratings and deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions including unemployment inflation or deflation consumer debt levels high fuel and energy costs and higher tax rates could have a negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions impacts us through i potential adverse effects from deteriorating and uncertain credit markets ii the negative impact on our suppliers and customers and iii an increase in operating costs from higher energy pricesimpact of credit market uncertainty and changes in credit ratingssignificant deterioration in the financial condition of large financial institutions in 2008 and 2009 resulted in a severe loss of liquidity and available credit in global credit markets and in more stringent borrowing terms we can provide no assurance that the credit market events during 2008 and 2009 will not occur again in the foreseeable future conditions and events in the global credit market could have a material adverse effect on our access to short and longterm borrowings to finance our operations and the terms and cost of that debt it is possible that one or more of the banks that provide us with financing under our revolving credit facility may fail to honor the terms of our existing credit facility or be financially unable to provide the unused credit 11table of contentsour overall credit rating may be negatively impacted by deteriorating and uncertain credit markets or other factors which may or may not be within our control the interest rates on our publicly issued debt and revolving credit facility are linked directly to our credit ratings accordingly any negative impact on our credit rating would likely result in higher interest rates and interest expense on any borrowings under our revolving credit facility or from future issuances of public debt and less favorable terms on other operating and financing arrangements in addition it could reduce the attractiveness of our vendor payment program where certain of our vendors finance payment obligations from us with designated third party financial institutions which could result in increased working capital requirements an inability to obtain sufficient financing at costeffective rates could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows impact on our suppliersour business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers ability andor willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms many factors outside our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms one such factor is a general decline in the economy and economic conditions and prolonged recessionary conditions these events could negatively affect our suppliers operations and make it difficult for them to obtain the credit lines or loans necessary to finance their operations in the shortterm or longterm and meet our product requirements financial or operational difficulties that some of our suppliers may face could also increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them we might not be able to pass our increased costs onto our customers in addition the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the offshoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience bankruptcies work

may have a negative impact on our customers net worth financial resources and disposable income while macroeconomic conditions have improved since 2008 and 2009 unemployment rates have remained at historically high levels consumer confidence continues to fluctuate at lower levels and payroll taxes have recently increased for most us workers as a result of the changes in tax legislation effective for 2013 this impact could reduce our customers willingness or ability to pay for accessories maintenance or repair of their vehicles which results in lower sales in our stores higher fuel costs may also reduce the overall number of miles driven by our customers resulting in less parts failures and elective maintenance required to be completed impact on operating expensesrising energy prices could directly impact our operating and product costs including our merchandise distribution commercial delivery utility and product acquisition costsbecause we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees and other costs we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers team members or other third parties for various actions from time to time we are involved in litigation involving claims related to among other things breach of contract tortious conduct employment law matters payment of wages asbestos exposure real estate and product defects the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial
