condition and results of operations on page fs18 for additional information on environmental matters and their impact on chevron and on the companys 2016 environmental expenditures refer to page fs18 and note 25 on page fs61 for a discussion of environmental remediation provisions and yearend reserves 19item 1a risk factorschevron is a global energy company and its operating and financial results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil gas and petrochemical businesses many of these risks are not within the companys control and could materially impact the companys results of operations and financial condition chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices chevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history of price volatility the single largest variable that affects the companys results of operations is the price of crude oil which can be influenced by general economic conditions industry inventory levels technology advancements production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec weatherrelated damage and disruptions competing fuel prices and geopolitical risks chevron evaluates the risk of changing commodity prices as part of its business planning process an investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil pricesextended periods of low prices for crude oil can have a material adverse impact on the companys results of operations financial condition and liquidity among other things the companys upstream earnings cash flows and capital and exploratory expenditure programs could be negatively affected as could its production and proved reserves upstream assets may also become impaired downstream earnings could be negatively affected because they depend upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales a significant or sustained decline in liquidity could adversely affect the companys credit ratings potentially increase financing costs and reduce access to debt markets the company may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings expenditure reductions and asset sales that are intended to compensate for such downturns in some cases liabilities associated with divested assets may return to the company when an acquirer of those assets subsequently declares bankruptcy in addition extended periods of low commodity prices can have a material adverse impact on the results of operations financial condition and liquidity of the companys suppliers vendors partners and equity affiliates upon which the companys own results of operations and financial condition dependsthe scope of chevrons business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources the company is in an extractive business therefore if it is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future production or through acquisitions the companys business will decline creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors including obtaining and renewing rights to explore develop and produce hydrocarbons drilling success ability to bring longleadtime capitalintensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties the companys operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond its control chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions the companys operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond its control including physical risks from hurricanes severe storms floods and other forms of severe weather war accidents civil unrest political events fires earthquakes system failures cyber threats and terrorist acts any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environmentchevrons risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets and to plan for their resiliency while capital investment reviews and decisions incorporate potential ranges of physical risks such as storm severity and frequency sea level rise air and water temperature precipitation fresh water access wind speed and earthquake severity among other factors it is difficult to predict with certainty the timing frequency or severity of such events any of which could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or financial conditioncyberattacks targeting chevrons process control networks or other digital infrastructure could have a material adverse impact on the companys business and results of operations there are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy from cyber threat actors including criminal hackers statesponsored intrusions industrial espionage and employee malfeasance although chevron devotes significant resources to prevent unwanted intrusions and to protect its systems and data the company has experienced and will continue to experience cyber incidents of varying degrees in the conduct of its business cyber threat actors could compromise the companys process control networks or other critical systems and infrastructure resulting in disruptions to its business operations injury to people harm to the environment or assets access to its financial reporting systems or loss misuse or corruption of critical data and proprietary information including intellectual property business information and that of its employees customers partners and other third parties cyber events could result in significant financial losses legal or regulatory violations reputational harm and legal liability and could ultimately have a material adverse effect on the companys business and results of operationsthe companys operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight chevrons results depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas 20industry the company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner however failure to manage these risks effectively could impair our ability to operate and result in unexpected incidents including releases explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury loss of life environmental damage loss of revenues legal liability andor disruption to operations chevron has implemented and maintains a system of corporate policies processes and systems behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety health environmental reliability and efficiency risks to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents in certain situations where chevron is not the operator the company may have limited influence and control over third parties which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks chevrons business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action the company produces transports refines and markets materials with potential toxicity and it purchases handles and disposes of other potentially toxic materials in the course of its business chevrons operations also produce byproducts which may be considered pollutants often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or government action either as a result of an accidental unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions about the effects of the companys operations on human health or the environment in addition to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the companys causation of or contribution to the asserted damage or to other mitigating factors for information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved including information relating to ecuador matters see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page fs45the company does not insure against all potential losses which could result in significant financial exposure the company does not have commercial insurance or thirdparty indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss as a result the company is to a substantial extent selfinsured for such events the company relies on existing liquidity financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet shortterm obligations that would arise from such an event or series of events the occurrence of a significant incident or unforeseen liability for which the company is not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or financial condition political instability and significant changes in the regulatory environment could harm chevrons business the companys operations particularly exploration and production can be affected by changing economic regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates as has occurred in the past actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the companys partially or wholly owned businesses or to impose additional taxes or royalties in certain locations governments have proposed or imposed restrictions on the companys operations export and exchange controls burdensome taxes and public disclosure requirements that might harm the companys competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties in other countries political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the companys continued presence in those countries and internal unrest acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the companys operations those developments have at times significantly affected the companys operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries in addition changes in national state or local environmental regulations or laws including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas such as those related to the use of hydraulic fracturing or bans on drilling could adversely affect the companys current or anticipated future operations and profitabilityregulation of greenhouse gas ghg emissions could increase chevrons operational costs and reduce demand for chevrons hydrocarbon and other products in the years ahead companies in the energy industry like chevron may be challenged by an increase in international and domestic regulation relating to ghg emissions such regulation could have the impact of curtailing profitability in the oil and gas sector or rendering the extraction of the companys oil and gas resources economically infeasible although the ieas world energy outlook scenarios anticipate global demand for oil to continue increasing until 2040 and even ghgconstrained scenarios such as the ieas 450 case anticipate significant demand for petroleum and natural gas given their respective advantages in transportation and power generation if a new onset of regulation contributes to a decline in the demand for the companys products this could have a material adverse effect on the company and its financial conditioninternational agreements eg the paris agreement and the kyoto protocol and national eg carbon tax capandtrade or efficiency standards regional and state legislation eg california ab32 and sb32 low carbon fuel standards and regulatory measures eg the us environmental protection agencys methane performance standards that aim to limit or reduce ghg 21emissions are currently in various stages of implementation for example the paris agreement went into effect in november 2016 and a number of countries are adopting policies to meet their paris agreement goals in the united states the company has been complying with currently implemented programs such as the federal renewable fuel standard program and related volume standards and state regulations such as california ab32 including the capandtrade program and related low carbon fuel standard obligations followon legislation to california ab32 known as california sb32 was signed into law in 2016 with effect in 2020 and is currently in the scoping plan phase separately other states and localities have also sought to directly regulate ghg emissions through mechanisms such as for example a carbon tax many of the foregoing are still in a proposal stage and others face legal challenge or legislative efforts to be repealed or significantly reformed thus even with respect to existing regulatory compliance obligations the landscape continues to be in a state of constant reassessment and legal challenge making it difficult to predict with certainty the ultimate impact that such regulations will have on the companyghg emissionsrelated laws and related regulations and the effects of operating in a potentially carbonconstrained environment may result in increased and substantial capital compliance operating and maintenance costs and could among other things reduce demand for hydrocarbons and the companys hydrocarbonbased products make the companys products more expensive adversely affect the economic feasibility of the companys resources and adversely affect the companys sales volumes revenues and margins ghg emissions eg carbon dioxide and methane that could be regulated include among others those associated with the companys exploration and production of hydrocarbons such as crude oil and natural gas the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil power generation the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined hydrocarbon products the processing liquefaction and regasification of natural gas the transportation of crude oil natural gas and related products and consumers or customers use of the companys hydrocarbon products many of these activities such as consumers and customers use of the companys products as well as actions taken by the companys competitors in response to such laws and regulations are beyond the companys control in addition increasing attention to climate change risks has resulted in an increased possibility of governmental investigations and potentially private litigation against the companyconsideration of ghg issues and the responses to those issues through international agreements and national regional or state legislation or regulations are integrated into the companys strategy and planning capital investment reviews and risk management tools and processes where applicable they are also factored into the companys longrange supply demand and energy price forecasts these forecasts reflect longrange effects from renewable fuel penetration energy efficiency standards climaterelated policy actions and demand response to oil and natural gas prices additionally the company assesses carbon pricing risks by considering carbon costs in these forecasts the actual level of expenditure required to comply with new or potential climate changerelated laws and regulations and amount of additional investments in new or existing technology or facilities such as carbon dioxide injection is difficult to predict with certainty and is expected to vary depending on the actual laws and regulations enacted in a jurisdiction the companys activities in it and market conditionsthe ultimate effect of international agreements and national regional and state legislation and regulatory measures to limit ghg emissions on the companys financial performance and the timing of these effects will depend on a number of factors such factors include among others the sectors covered the greenhouse gas emissions reductions required the extent to which chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions the price and availability of emission allowances and credits and the extent to which the company is able to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the companys products in the competitive marketplace further the ultimate impact of ghg emissionsrelated agreements legislation and measures on the companys financial performance is highly uncertain because the company is unable to predict with certainty for a multitude of individual jurisdictions the outcome of political decisionmaking processes and the variables and tradeoffs that inevitably occur in connection with such processeschanges in managements estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period in preparing the companys periodic reports under the securities exchange act of 1934 including its financial statements chevrons management is required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date these estimates and assumptions are based on managements best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include impairments to property plant and equipment estimates of crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves accruals for estimated liabilities including litigation reserves and measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans changes in estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the assumptions such as changes in the companys business plans general market conditions or changes in commodity prices could affect reported amounts of assets liabilities or expenses22
